However, just as the text suggests, regular practice and self-reflection can help us gain greater control over our thoughts.\n\nIn a startup context, this verse is particularly relevant because entrepreneurs often face a multitude of distractions and competing priorities. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day operations of the business and lose sight of the bigger picture. However, by taking time for regular reflection and meditation, founders can cultivate greater clarity and focus, making it easier to make informed decisions and stay on track towards their goals.\n\nAdditionally, this verse highlights the importance of self-awareness and introspection in managing our thoughts. By understanding the nature of our own minds and recognizing the patterns that lead us astray, we can learn to intervene before negative thought spirals take hold. This can help us stay more grounded and centered, even in the midst of chaos or uncertainty.\n\nOverall, this verse serves as a reminder that managing our thoughts is an ongoing practice, requiring both discipline and self-compassion. By approaching our inner lives with regularity and reverence, we can cultivate greater mental clarity and focus, both personally and professionally.", "personal": "Verse: \"The mind is restless and difficult to restrain, but it can be controlled by higher practices. A calm mind leads to purity and transcendence, resulting in self-realization.\" (Bhagavad Gita 6:5-6)\n\nIn the modern world, this verse speaks to the importance of managing our thoughts and emotions in order to achieve inner peace and spiritual growth. The mind is often seen as a wild horse that needs to be tamed through meditation, prayer, or other spiritual practices. When we learn to control our thoughts and focus on higher principles such as love, compassion, and selflessness, we can cultivate a calm and pure mind. This state of mind allows us to connect with our true selves and experience a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment in life. By practicing these higher principles consistently, we can eventually achieve self-realization, which is the realization that we are all part of a larger divine consciousness.", "student": "Verse: \"The mind is restless and difficult to restrain, but it can be controlled by higher practices. The senses are said to be the gateways to the world, but they also lead one to repeated birth and death. To withdraw these senses from their objects is called sense control.\" - Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 59-60\n\nIn the modern world, this verse highlights the importance of mindfulness and self-discipline in controlling our thoughts and actions. The mind can often be distracted and difficult to focus, but through higher practices such as meditation, yoga, or deep reflection, we can learn to restrain it. Our senses, including sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell, are constantly bombarded by external stimuli that can lead us down a path of repetitive cycles of birth and death, known as samsara in Hindu philosophy. By learning to withdraw our senses from their objects, we can break free from these cycles and achieve inner peace and enlightenment. This practice requires discipline and consistent effort, but the rewards are immeasurable. In a world filled with distractions and sensory overload, learning to control our mind and senses is more important than ever before."}}, "1.7": {"sanskrit": " \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0915\u0902 \u0924\u0941 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u092c\u094b\u0927 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e |\u0928\u093e\u092f\u0915\u093e \u092e\u092e \u0938\u0948\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0902\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0940\u092e\u093f \u0924\u0947 || 7||.\nasm\u0101ka\u1e41 tu vi\u015bhi\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101 ye t\u0101nnibodha dwijottama n\u0101yak\u0101 mama sainyasya sanj\u00f1\u0101rtha\u1e41 t\u0101nbrav\u012bmi te.\nasmakam tu vishishta ye tannibodha dwijottama nayaka mama sainyasya sanjnartham tanbravimi te.", "english": " O best of Brahmins, hear too about the principal generals on our side, who are especially qualified to lead.

This side of his character is well revealed in an incident that took place towards the end of the Mahabharat war..\nDuryodhana was badly injured, and only a handful of warriors were remaining on the Kaurava side. Ashwatthama was one of them. He wanted to avenge his father Dronacharaya and his friends Kauravas' death. He sneaked into the Pandava camp at night while everyone was fast asleep and\u00a0went on\u00a0a carnage. Several warriors including Draupadi\u2019s five sons were killed in this attack. The Pandavas, along with Draupadi and Shree Krishna were away that night. When they returned to the camp, they were devasted. Arjun went after Ashwatthama, caught him and threw him at the feet of Draupadi, who was grieving the death of her young sons. Bheem was raged and wanted to kill Ashwatthama right way, but Draupadi was a soft-hearted lady of forgiving nature. She said that Ashwatthama was their Guru Drona\u2019s son and a Brahmin, therefore, they should forgive him. Arjun was unsure what to do next and wanted guidance from Shree Krishna, who then said, \u201cA respect-worthy Brahmin must be forgiven even if he may have temporarily fallen from virtue.\u00a0 But a person who approaches to kill with a lethal weapon must certainly be punished.\u201d\u00a0 Arjun understood what the Lord meant; he did not kill Ashwatthama.

Just like Arjun, they may initially have strong values and beliefs, but when faced with a difficult situation, they become overwhelmed by emotions and give up on what needs to be done. This can happen to anyone, regardless of their spiritual knowledge or background.\n\nIn the modern context, we see this in various aspects of life, such as in our careers, relationships, or personal goals. We may have a clear vision of where we want to go, but when obstacles arise, we lose confidence and become disheartened. This can lead to procrastination, avoidance, or even giving up altogether.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita teaches us that our true self is not bound by material attachments, but rather by spiritual knowledge and devotion to God. By understanding the nature of our soul and recognizing its eternal connection with the Supreme, we can overcome the obstacles in our path and fulfill our duties with courage and determination.\n\nIn Arjun's case, he had initially surrendered himself completely to Lord Krishna, but his material attachments clouded his judgment and caused him to lose faith. The Lord then guided him through the teachings of the Gita, helping him to understand that true happiness and fulfillment come from performing our duties selflessly, without any attachment to the results.\n\nIn our own lives, we can learn from Arjun's experience and strive to maintain a balance between material and spiritual pursuits. By cultivating a deep sense of devotion and detachment, we can overcome the obstacles in our path and fulfill our duties with courage and determination, just like Arjun did in the end.", "student": "In today's world, we can relate Arjun's state of mind to someone who has become overwhelmed by their material attachments and is struggling with grief or distress.

This can lead to a sense of dejection and dereliction of duty, causing them to lose sight of their true purpose and responsibilities.\n\nArjun's reluctance to fight the war was not due to any lack of spiritual knowledge or devotion. In fact, he had received many boons from celestial beings in his past life and was considered a great warrior and devotee. However, his material attachments had clouded his judgment and caused him to lose faith in himself and his duty.\n\nIn our modern world, we often face similar challenges. We may have all the knowledge and resources at our disposal, but if we are not able to overcome our material attachments, we can easily fall into a state of distress and dejection. This is where the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita become relevant.\n\nThe Lord's intention in confusing Arjun was to bring forth the knowledge of the Gita for future generations. By putting forth several arguments and justifications, Arjun highlighted the challenges that we may face in our own lives. The subsequent chapters of the Gita provide us with the guidance and wisdom needed to overcome these challenges and fulfill our duties.\n\nIn today's world, where materialism and greed are rampant, it is essential that we learn to prioritize our spiritual values over our material desires.

Arjun was debating whether it would be desirable to defeat the Kauravas or to be defeated by them. Both alternatives seemed like defeat, for if he did win the war by slaying the Kauravas, he would have no further desire to live..\nHowever, the fact was that Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. had acted ignobly by taking the side of the unrighteous Kauravas. The word arthak\u0101m has been used for them, implying, \u201cattached to wealth and position,\u201d they had taken the side of the wicked Duryodhan. So, killing them in the war was a natural consequence. In fact, after the war, Bheeshma himself admitted that a teacher who acts ignobly is fit to be abandoned..\nHere, special mention needs to be made of Bheeshma. According to the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam (verse 9.22.19), he was a great devotee of Shree Krishna. He was a master of his senses, and an icon of chivalry and generosity. He was a knower of the Absolute Truth, and had vowed to always speak the truth in his life. Even death could only come to him when he chose to accept it. For various reasons, he is enumerated amongst the twelve great personalities, or Mah\u0101jans, mentioned in the Bh\u0101gavatam:.\nswayambh\u016br n\u0101rada\u1e25 \u015bhambhu\u1e25 kum\u0101ra\u1e25 kapilo manu\u1e25prahl\u0101do janako bh\u012b\u1e63hmo balir vaiy\u0101sakir vayam (6.3.20) [v1].\n\u201cThese are the twelve great knowers of religious principles\u2014the first-born Brahma, Sage Narad, Lord Shiv, the four Kumars, Bhagavan Kapil (son of Devahuti), Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlad Maharaj, Janak Maharaj, Grandfather Bheeshma, Bali Maharaj, Shukadev Muni, and Ved Vyas.\u201d.\nHence, Bheeshma was an enlightened soul, whose actions could never be against the principles of dharma. However, his profound character was beyond mundane reasoning. Even though he fought on the side of the Kauravas, he said to Yudhishthir (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) before the war, \u201cI am obliged to combat on the side of unrighteousness, but I give you the boon that you will be victorious.\u201d Bheeshma knew that the righteous Pandavas, who had the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna on their side, could never lose. By taking the side of adharma (unrighteousness), he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war. He thus offered the biggest sacrifice of laying down his life, to assist the divine pastimes of Lord Krishna..\nShree Krishna was well aware of Bheeshma\u2019s deep devotion toward him, despite his fighting from the side of the Kauravas. That is why he upheld Bheeshma\u2019s vow by breaking his own. Bheeshma resolved on a particular day during the war, that before sunset on the next day, he would either kill Arjun, the foremost Pandava warrior, or else to save him, Shree Krishna would have to break his own vow of not lifting weapons in the battle of Mahabharat. Poets describe the vow that Bheeshma made:.\n\u0101ju jo harihi\u1e45 na \u015bhastra gah\u0101\u016b\u00f1,tau l\u0101jahu\u00f1 ga\u1e45g\u0101 janan\u012b ko \u015bh\u0101ntanu suta na kah\u0101\u016b\u00f1(Saint Soordas) [v2].\n\u201cIf I do not make the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna lift weapons, then I will shame my mother Ganga, and I am not the son of King Shantanu.\u201d Bheeshma fought so valiantly that Arjun\u2019s chariot was shattered, and he was stranded on the ground. At that stage, Shree Krishna lifted the chariot wheel and came forward to prevent Bheeshma from killing Arjun. Bheeshma saw the Lord with the chariot wheel in his hand as a weapon, and broke into a big smile. He understood that Bhaktavatsala Bhagav\u0101n (God who gives pleasure to his devotees) had broken his own vow to honor the vow of his devotee..\nIn fact, Bheeshma\u2019s devotion to Lord Krishna had a very rasik (full of sweetness) flavor to it. He used to meditate on Shree Krishna\u2019s pastimes in Vrindavan. There, in the evening when the Lord would return to the village after grazing the cows in the forest, the dust raised from the hooves of the cows would deck his charming face, increasing its beauty and sweetness. During the battle of Mahabharat, the dust raised from the hooves of the horses too added to Shree Krishna\u2019s beauty, and he loved having dar\u015bhan (divine vision) of his Lord there..\nIn the last stage of his life, as he lay for six months on the bed of arrows, he meditated on that very vision of God, offering the following prayer to Him:.\nyudhi turaga-rajo-vidh\u016bmra-vi\u1e63hvak-kacha-lulita-\u015bhramav\u0101ry-ala\u1e45k\u1e5bit\u0101syemama ni\u015bhita-\u015bharair vibhidyam\u0101na-tvachi vilasat-kavache \u2019stu k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a \u0101tm\u0101(Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.34) [v3].\n\u201cOn the battlefield, Lord Krishna\u2019s flowing hair was covered with white dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and his face was covered with sweat beads because of his physical effort in driving the chariot. These were like ornaments enhancing the beauty of my Lord; and the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows further intensified the decorations. Let my mind meditate unto that Shree Krishna.\u201d.\nLord Krishna reciprocated his loving devotion by himself coming to meet Bheeshma on his deathbed of arrows, and with the dar\u015bhan of God in front of him, Bheeshma, the great mah\u0101jan, left his body, of his own volition..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In modern terms, this verse highlights the complexity of decision-making when faced with multiple unfavorable outcomes.

Moreover, some of their former allies had sided with the Kauravas, making it difficult for them to distinguish friend from foe on the battlefield. This dilemma illustrates the importance of evaluating all possible outcomes and consequences before making a decision, even in situations where every choice seems undesirable. It also underscores the significance of maintaining principles and values, as Bheeshma did by fighting for the Kauravas despite his devotion to Lord Krishna. Ultimately, this verse emphasizes the need to make decisions based on a deep understanding of one's own values and the potential consequences of each option, rather than simply choosing the least bad outcome.", "startup": "In modern terms, Verse 2.6 can be interpreted as follows: When making a decision, we weigh the potential outcomes and their consequences.

By doing so, we can make more informed decisions that align with our values and principles, even in difficult situations.\n\nMoreover, this verse also highlights the importance of integrity and standing up for what is right, even if it may lead to temporary setbacks or losses. Bheeshma's decision to fight on the side of the Kauravas despite his deep devotion to Lord Krishna was a challenging one, but he remained true to his principles and ultimately proved that unrighteousness cannot prevail in the face of righteousness. This lesson can be applied in today's world where we often face difficult moral dilemmas and must choose between short-term gains and long-term values.\n\nIn summary, Verse 2.6 teaches us to make informed decisions by considering all potential outcomes and their consequences, while also remaining true to our principles and values, even in challenging situations.

Arjun, a character from the Bhagavad Gita, was facing such a dilemma during the Mahabharat war. He couldn't decide whether it would be better for him and his allies to win the war against their enemies or to lose because of the consequences that followed either outcome. In modern times, we too face similar situations where we have to make choices with uncertain outcomes. For instance, starting a new business venture, pursuing higher education, or moving to a new city can all lead to unpredictable results. It's essential to evaluate all possible outcomes and their consequences before making a decision.

In such situations, it's crucial to remember that our ultimate goal should be to act with righteousness and integrity, regardless of the outcome.

Ultimately, killing these individuals in battle was inevitable.\n\nBheeshma, a highly respected figure in Hindu mythology, was known for his devotion to Lord Krishna despite fighting on the side of the Kauravas. His actions were beyond rational reasoning, as he had vowed to always speak the truth and fight against unrighteousness. Before the war began, Bheeshma even promised Yudhishthir that the Pandavas would emerge victorious. This shows that Bheeshma's allegiance was not with the Kauravas but with dharma (righteousness).\n\nDuring the battle, Bheeshma fought valiantly and almost killed Arjun, but Lord Krishna intervened to honor Bheeshma's vow. Bheeshma's devotion to Lord Krishna was so strong that he meditated on the Lord's pastimes in Vrindavan, finding beauty in the dust raised by the horses' hooves. In his final moments, as he lay dying from arrows, Bheeshma continued to think of Lord Krishna and found solace in the wounds inflicted upon him by his own arrows.\n\nThis story serves as a reminder that even when faced with difficult decisions, it is essential to consider all possible outcomes and their consequences. Arjun was struggling to decide whether it would be better for him to defeat the Kauravas or lose to them. However, Bheeshma's actions showed that sometimes, doing what is righteous, even if it seems like a loss, is the best course of action.\n\nIn today's world, this lesson can be applied in various aspects of life. Whether it is choosing between two job offers or deciding which candidate to support in an election, we must evaluate all possible outcomes and their consequences before making a decision. It is also important to remember that doing what is righteous, even if it seems like a loss, is often the best course of action in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, Bheeshma's devotion to Lord Krishna can serve as an inspiration for us to cultivate our own spiritual practices and deepen our relationship with God. By meditating on His pastimes and offerings, we too can experience the sweetness of His divine presence in our lives.\n\nIn conclusion, Bheeshma's actions during the Mahabharat war serve as a valuable lesson for us in today's world. They remind us to consider all possible outcomes and their consequences before making decisions, and to strive towards doing what is righteous, even if it seems like a loss.

This verse highlights the importance of having a spiritual guide or mentor in our lives, especially in times of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nIn the modern world, where we are constantly bombarded with information and distractions, it can be challenging to make decisions that align with our values and goals. A Guru, whether it's a teacher, coach, or mentor, can help us navigate through these challenges by providing clarity, perspective, and guidance.

The wise are not deluded by this.\n                        .\nWith immaculate logic, Shree Krishna establishes the principle of transmigration of the soul from lifetime to lifetime. He explains that in one lifetime itself, we change bodies from childhood to youth to maturity and then to old age. In fact, modern science informs us that cells within the body undergo regeneration\u2014old cells die away and new ones take their place. It is estimated that within seven years, practically all the cells of the body change. Further, the molecules within the cells change even more rapidly. With every breath we inhale, oxygen molecules are absorbed into our cells via the metabolic processes, and molecules that were heretofore locked within the cells are released as carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that in one year\u2019s time, about ninety-eight percent of our bodily molecules change. And yet, despite the continual change of the body, we perceive that we are the same person. That is because we are not the material body, but the spiritual soul seated within..\nIn this verse, the word deha means \u201cthe body\u201d and dehi means \u201cpossessor of the body,\u201d or the soul. Shree Krishna draws Arjun\u2019s attention to the fact that, since the body is constantly changing, in one lifetime itself, the soul passes through many bodies. Similarly, at the time of death, it passes into another body. Actually, what we term as \u201cdeath\u201d in worldly parlance is merely the soul discarding its old dysfunctional body, and what we call \u201cbirth\u201d is the soul taking on a new body elsewhere. This is the principle of reincarnation..\nMost Oriental philosophies accept this concept of reincarnation. It is an integral part of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In Buddhism, the Buddha made references to his past lives repeatedly. Many people do not know the extent to which reincarnation was a part of the belief system of the Occidental philosophies as well. In ancient classical Western religious and philosophic circles, famous thinkers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates accepted reincarnation to be true, and their views were also reflected in Orphism, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Manichaenism, and Gnosticism. Within the mainstream Abrahamic faiths, mystics of the three major religions also supported reincarnation. Examples include Jews who studied the Kabbalah, the Christian Cathars, and Muslim Shia sects such as the Alawi Shias and the Druze. For example, amongst Occidental religions, Josephus, the great ancient Jewish historian, used language in his writings that seem to ascribe belief in some form of reincarnation among the Pharisees and Essenes of his day. Certainly the Jewish Kabbalah prescribes to the idea of reincarnation as gilgul neshamot, or the \u201crolling of the soul.\u201d The great Sufi mystic, Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi declared:.\nI died out of the stone and I became a plant;I died out of the plant and became an animal;I died out of the animal and became a man.Why then should I fear to die?When did I grow less by dying?I shall die out of man and shall become an angel!\u201d [v10].\nMany of the early Christians believed in the concept of reincarnation. Christian history informs us that, in the 553 AD, the Council of Nicaea, a conclave, was held to discuss the principle of reincarnation, and it was thereafter declared a heresy, apparently to increase the authority of the Church over the lives of the people. Until then, it was commonly accepted. Jesus indirectly proclaimed this doctrine when he told his disciples that John the Baptist was Elijah the Prophet reincarnated (Matthew 11:13-14, Matthew 17:10-13). This is also mentioned in the Old Testament (Malachi 4:5). Origen, the most learned of the Christian Fathers, declared: \u201cEvery man receives a body for himself according to his deserts in former lives [v11].\u201d Solomon\u2019s Book of Wisdom says: \u201cTo be born in sound body with sound limbs is a reward of the virtues of the past lives.\u201d (Wisdom of Solomon 8:19-20) [v12].\nBelief in reincarnation is also found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia. Moving to more recent centuries and civilizations, reincarnation has been affirmed by Rosicrucians, Spiritism, Theosophists, and New Age followers. Even more recently, it has even been studied in serious scientific circles at major universities, exemplified by the works of Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker, both at the University of Virginia..\nWithout accepting the concept of rebirth, it is difficult to make sense out of the suffering, chaos, and incompleteness of the world, and hence, many famous western thinkers believed in this principle. Virgil and Ovid regarded this doctrine as self-evident. The German philosophers Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, and Lessing accepted it. Amongst the more recent philosophers, Hume, Spencer, and Max Mueller, all recognized it as an incontrovertible doctrine. Among Western poets, Browing, Rosetti, Tennyson, and Wordsworth, to mention just a few, all believed in it..\nShree Krishna has previously declared that the wise do not lament. But the fact remains that we do experience happiness and distress. What is the reason for it? He now explains this concept..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In modern times, the principle of transmigration of the soul, or reincarnation, has been supported by scientific evidence as well as ancient philosophies and religions.

This is because we are not the material body, but the spiritual soul seated within.\n\nShree Krishna's explanation of reincarnation in verse 2.13 is still relevant in today's world. Just as we undergo transformation from childhood to old age in one lifetime, at the time of death, our soul passes into another body.

Thus, both the perceptions of happiness and distress experienced through the senses are transitory. If we permit ourselves to be affected by them, we will sway like a pendulum from side to side. A person of discrimination should practice to tolerate both the feelings of happiness and distress without being disturbed by them..\nThe technique of Vipassan\u0101, which is the primary technique of self-realization in Buddhism, is based on this principle of tolerance of sense perceptions. Its practice helps eliminate desire, which, as stated in the four noble truths (the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation), is the cause of all suffering.

This is because these sensations are temporary and fleeting, much like the changing seasons.\n\nAs an Expert Teacher in Bhagvad Gita, I believe that it's crucial to learn how to tolerate these fluctuations in our emotions without being overwhelmed by them. In the context of the modern world, this can be applied to our professional lives as well. As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are constantly faced with a multitude of challenges and setbacks. While some may bring us moments of joy and satisfaction, others can leave us feeling disheartened and discouraged.\n\nThe key is to learn how to tolerate these fluctuations in our emotions without being disturbed by them.

Steve Jobs once said, \"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.\" This quote highlights the importance of tolerating the ups and downs of our experiences, as it's often only in hindsight that we can see how they fit into a larger picture.\n\nIn summary, the verse from Bhagvad Gita encourages us to learn how to tolerate the fleeting sensations of happiness and distress without being disturbed by them.

He now encourages Arjun to rise above these dualities through discrimination. In order to develop this discrimination, we first need to understand the answers to two important questions: 1) Why do we aspire for happiness? 2) Why doesn\u2019t material happiness satisfy us?.\nThe answer to the first question is very simple. God is an ocean of infinite bliss, and we souls are his tiny parts. This basically means that we are tiny fragments of an infinite ocean of bliss. Swami Vivekananda would address people by saying, \u201cO ye children of immortal bliss.\u201d Just as a child is drawn to his or her mother, each part is naturally drawn toward its whole. Similarly, being infinitesimal parts of the ocean of bliss, we souls too are drawn to this bliss. Hence, everything we do in the world is for the sake of happiness. We all may have different views regarding where happiness lies or what form it might take, but all living beings seek nothing apart from it. This answers the first question..\nNow, let\u2019s understand the answer to the second question. The soul, being a tiny part of God, is divine in nature like God himself. Hence the happiness that the soul seeks is also divine. Such happiness must possess the following three characteristics:.\nIt must be infinite in extent..\nIt must be permanent..\nIt must be ever-fresh..\nSuch is the happiness of God, which is described as sat-chit-\u0101nand, or eternal-sentient-ocean of bliss. However, the happiness we experience from the contact of the senses with their objects is the reverse; it is temporary, finite, and insentient. Thus, the material happiness that we perceive through the body can never satisfy the divine soul..\nWith this discrimination, we must practice to tolerate the perception of material happiness. Similarly, we must tolerate the sensation of material distress. (This second aspect is discussed in detail in many future verses, such as 2.48, 5.20, etc.) Only then will we rise above these dualities and the material energy will no longer bind us..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, where success and failure are two extremes, it is essential to develop a sense of detachment from both happiness and distress.

However, this happiness is fleeting and does not last long. Similarly, when things do not go as planned, we experience distress, which can also be overwhelming at times.\n\nTo rise above these dualities and achieve true liberation, we need to understand the nature of happiness and why it doesn't satisfy us in the long run. The answer lies in the fact that our souls are divine in nature, just like God, and seek infinite, permanent, and ever-fresh bliss. However, the material happiness we perceive through our senses is temporary, finite, and insentient, which cannot satisfy our divine soul.\n\nTo develop a sense of detachment from both happiness and distress, we need to practice tolerance towards both. We must learn to tolerate the perception of material happiness without getting carried away by it, and similarly, we must tolerate the sensation of material distress without letting it overwhelm us. Only then will we rise above these dualities and not be bound by the material energy.\n\nIn conclusion, in today's corporate world, where success and failure are two extremes, developing a sense of detachment from both happiness and distress is essential to achieve true liberation.

However, as Shree Krishna teaches Arjun in Bhagavad Gita, true liberation comes from learning to remain steady in both.\n\nIn the modern context, this means developing a sense of detachment from external circumstances. Whether we're experiencing success or failure, we should strive to maintain an inner calm and not let our emotions be swayed by temporary events. This is because true happiness lies within us, as we are all divine souls seeking bliss.\n\nThe material pleasures that we pursue in the world may provide temporary satisfaction, but they cannot fulfill our deepest desires for eternity, sentience, and ever-freshness. Therefore, it's essential to cultivate a sense of tolerance towards both happiness and distress, recognizing that they are both fleeting sensations.\n\nIn the startup world, this can be particularly challenging as success and failure often come in quick succession. However, by practicing detachment and remaining steady in both, we can avoid getting carried away by either extreme and make more level-headed decisions.

Material happiness, on the other hand, is temporary, finite, and insentient. By recognizing this difference, we can learn to tolerate both positive and negative experiences without being overwhelmed by them.\n\nThis tolerance is not easy to achieve, but it's essential for spiritual growth. When we learn to remain steady in the face of happiness and distress, we become less attached to material possessions and more focused on our true nature as divine souls. This detachment allows us to rise above the material energy and experience true liberation or moksha.\n\nIn practical terms, this means learning how to manage our emotions and reactions to different situations.

This helps us stay focused on our spiritual goals and avoid being bound by the material energy.\n\nIn summary, this verse encourages us to develop a sense of discrimination that allows us to rise above the dualities of happiness and distress in order to achieve true liberation or moksha.

For example, in our professional lives, we may experience both success and failure. If we are too attached to success or too distressed by failure, it can lead to instability and hinder our progress. However, if we remain steady and unchanged in the face of these circumstances, we can make better decisions and continue moving forward.\n\nSimilarly, in our personal lives, we may encounter both happiness and distress in relationships, health, or other areas.

God is everlasting. Thus he is sat (eternally existing). Hence, a name for him in the Vedas is sat-chit-\u0101nand (eternal-full of knowledge-ocean of bliss)..\n2. The soul is imperishable, and hence it is sat. However, the body will cease to exist one day, and hence it is asat (temporary). The soul is also sat-chit-\u0101nand, but it is also a\u1e47u (tiny). Hence the soul is a\u1e47u sat, a\u1e47u chit, and a\u1e47u \u0101nand..\n3. The entity Maya from which the world has been made is eternal, or sat. However, all material objects we see around us came into existence and will be destroyed with time. Thus, they can all be termed as asat, or temporary. So while the world itself is asat, it is only the entity Maya that is sat..\nWhen we say that the world is asat, this should not be confused with mithy\u0101. Asat (temporary) does not mean mithy\u0101 (non-existent). Some philosophers claim that the world is mithy\u0101, or \u201cnon-existent.\u201d They assert that it is only the ignorance within us that is making us perceive the world, and once we are situated in brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge of the Supreme) the world will cease to exist. However, if this were true, then the world should no longer have remained for the God-realized Saints. Since they had destroyed their ignorance, the world should have stopped existing for them. Why then did these Saints write books even after attaining the state of God-realization? Where did the paper and pen come from?

Technology, for instance, is constantly evolving and becoming obsolete at an alarming rate. What was once considered cutting-edge and essential can quickly become outdated and irrelevant. This is evident in the rapid advancements in fields like electronics, software, and communication technology.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also things that are eternal or everlasting. These are the fundamental principles and values that underpin our society and culture. They include concepts like justice, equality, freedom, and human rights. These ideals have stood the test of time and continue to be relevant and important in today's world.\n\nThe verse also emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of both transient and eternal entities. This requires a deep introspection and reflection on our own values and beliefs. It involves questioning whether these things are truly enduring or fleeting, and whether they align with the eternal principles that we hold dear.\n\nIn the corporate world, this concept can be applied in several ways. Firstly, it highlights the importance of staying adaptable and flexible in a rapidly changing business environment. Companies must be able to quickly respond to new trends and technologies while also holding onto their core values and principles. Secondly, it underscores the need for continuous learning and development, as knowledge and skills become obsolete over time. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of staying true to one's own values and beliefs, even in the face of external pressures or challenges.\n\nIn summary, the verse from Bhagavad Gita serves as a powerful reminder that our world is constantly evolving and changing, but there are also fundamental principles and values that remain constant.

The verse encourages us to distinguish between what is temporary and what is eternal, and to focus our efforts and resources on the latter. It also reminds us that everything in existence has both temporary and eternal aspects, and we must strive to understand and appreciate both.\n\nIn the context of entrepreneurship and startups, this verse can be interpreted as a call to balance short-term goals with long-term vision.

This question has also been answered by Ved Vyas:.\nvyaktireko gandhavat (Brahma S\u016btra 2.3.26) [v21].\n\u201cFragrance is a quality of the flower. But the garden where the flower grows also becomes fragrant.\u201d This means that the flower is able to pass on its fragrant quality to the garden.

But for those who have dispelled this illusion, the fear of death disappears.\n\nThe concept of murder being a punishable offense is not because nobody can kill anyone, but because destroying someone's physical body is considered violence, which is against the teachings of the Vedas. The Vedas also instruct us to not commit violence towards any living being (m\u0101 hinsy\u0101t sarvabh\u016bt\u0101ni). However, there are exceptions where violence may be necessary for self-protection in certain situations such as when one's life is being threatened or their sustenance is being taken away.\n\nIn the context of Arjun's situation, Shree Krishna will explain whether violence or non-violence is appropriate and why.

The first group believes that the soul has the power to kill another soul, while the second group thinks that the soul itself can be killed. However, this is an illusion because in reality, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed.\n\nThis concept of the soul being indestructible can be understood through a simple analogy. In our dreams, we may experience situations where our body is harmed or destroyed, but upon waking up, we realize that it was just an illusion. Similarly, in our waking state, when we identify ourselves with our physical bodies and believe that they are permanent, we fear the experience of death. But for those who have dispelled this illusion, the fear of death disappears because they understand that the soul is eternal and indestructible.\n\nThe concept of violence and murder in modern society can be explained by understanding that the body is just a temporary vehicle for the soul. Destroying another person's body is considered violence, which is forbidden. However, there are exceptions to this rule in certain situations where self-protection becomes necessary. For example, if someone is attacking us with lethal weapons or trying to harm us, we may have to use violence to defend ourselves. In Arjun's case, Shree Krishna will explain whether violence or non-violence is appropriate for him and why in the course of their dialogue.

For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed\" (2.19) in the context of the modern world means that both the person who believes that the soul has the power to kill and the person who thinks that the soul can be killed are lacking in true knowledge. In reality, the soul is not capable of killing or being killed because it is separate from the physical body.\n\nIn today's society, this concept can be applied in various ways. For instance, some people believe that violence or harming others will lead to a positive outcome for themselves. However, true knowledge teaches us that causing harm to another person's body does not affect their soul, and ultimately, it is against the principles of non-violence and compassion.\n\nSimilarly, some individuals may fear death due to their identification with the physical body. However, true knowledge reveals that the soul is eternal and cannot be destroyed by the death of the body. This realization can help us overcome our fears and live a more fulfilling life.\n\nIn summary, understanding the true nature of the soul as separate from the body can lead to a deeper sense of compassion, non-violence, and fearlessness in today's world."}}, "2.20": {"sanskrit": " \u0928 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u092e\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0935\u093e \u0915\u0926\u093e\u091a\u093f\u0928\u093e\u092f\u0902 \u092d\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0935\u093e \u0928 \u092d\u0942\u092f: |\u0905\u091c\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f: \u0936\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094b\u093d\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u094b\u0928 \u0939\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0928\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0947 || 20||.\nna j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 kad\u0101chinn\u0101ya\u1e41 bh\u016btv\u0101 bhavit\u0101 v\u0101 na bh\u016bya\u1e25ajo nitya\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101\u015bhvato \u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47ona hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bhar\u012bre.\nna jayate mriyate va kadachinnayam bhutva bhavita va na bhuyahajo nityah shashvato \u2019yam puranona hanyate hanyamane sharire.", "english": " The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be.

When garments become torn and useless, we discard them in favor of new ones, but in doing so we do not change ourselves. In the same manner, the soul remains unchanged, when it discards its worn-out body and takes birth in a new body elsewhere..\nThe Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan gives the following argument to prove the existence of rebirth:.\nj\u0101tasya har\u1e63habhaya\u015bhoka sampratipatte\u1e25 (3.1.18) [v27].\nIt states that if you observe a little baby, you will find it sometimes becomes happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes fearful, without any apparent reason. According to the Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan, the little baby is remembering its past life, and hence experiencing these emotions. However, as it grows up, the impressions of the present life are imprinted so strongly upon its mind, that they erase most past memories. Besides, the processes of death and birth are also so painful to the soul that they erase a substantial portion of the past life\u2019s memories..\nThe Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan gives another argument in support of rebirth: stany\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63h\u0101t (3.1.21) [v28] It says that a newborn baby has no knowledge of language. How then can a mother teach her baby to suckle her breast when she inserts it in the baby\u2019s mouth? However, the newborn child has drunk milk in infinite past lifetimes, even in animal forms, from the breasts, teats, and udders of innumerable mothers. Hence, when the mother puts her breast in the baby\u2019s mouth, it automatically starts suckling based on past practice..\nWithout accepting the concept of rebirth, the disparity between human beings becomes inexplicable and irrational. For example, let us suppose one man is blind from birth. If that person asks why he was punished in this way, what logical answer can be given to him? If we say it was a result of his karmas, he may argue that the present life is the only life he has, and therefore, there are no past karmas at the time of birth that should afflict him. If we say it was the will of God, it would also seem implausible, since God is all-merciful and would not unnecessarily want anyone to be blind. The only logical explanation is that the person was born blind as a consequence of karmas from past lives.

Just as we replace old and worn-out clothes with new ones when they become uncomfortable or no longer serve their purpose, our soul also sheds its old body at the time of death and enters a new one during rebirth. This concept of rebirth is supported by philosophical arguments such as the observation that babies sometimes exhibit emotions without any apparent reason, which may be a result of remembering past lives. Additionally, the fact that newborns have no knowledge of language but are able to instinctively suckle from their mother's breast suggests that they may have drunk milk and learned this skill in past lives.

Instead, they should embrace new ideas, technologies, and approaches that align with their evolving goals and objectives. This process requires courage, adaptability, and a willingness to learn and unlearn simultaneously.\n\nThe Nyaya Darshan's argument for rebirth can also be interpreted as a reminder of the interconnectedness between our past experiences and present actions. Our memories, values, and beliefs shape our current decisions and behaviors, just as they did in previous lifetimes. This perspective highlights the importance of introspection, self-reflection, and personal growth to overcome negative patterns and cultivate positive ones.\n\nIn summary, this verse encourages us to view personal transformation and growth as an ongoing process that transcends physical death and rebirth. It invites us to shed old beliefs and habits and embrace new perspectives and values continuously.

Just as we replace old clothes with new ones when they become worn out, our soul also sheds its old and decaying body at the time of death and enters a new one during rebirth. This comparison highlights that just as we don't change who we are when we change our clothes, our true self or soul remains unchanged during the process of rebirth.\n\nIn modern times, the concept of rebirth is often challenged due to scientific advancements and rational thinking. However, ancient Indian philosophies like Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan provide logical arguments to support the existence of rebirth. For instance, the argument that a newborn baby sometimes experiences emotions without any apparent reason suggests that they might be remembering their past lives. Additionally, the fact that a newborn baby has no knowledge of language but instinctively knows how to suckle is also explained by the concept of past life experiences.\n\nThe disparity between human beings can also be explained through the belief in rebirth. For example, if we consider the case of a person who is blind from birth, it becomes challenging to explain why they were born with this disability. If we attribute it to God's will or past karmas, it may seem implausible since God is all-merciful and would not want anyone to be blind unnecessarily.

The concept of rebirth is supported by logical arguments from ancient Indian philosophies like Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan and helps to explain certain phenomena that are difficult to understand otherwise.", "student": "In today's world, this verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for personal growth and transformation. Just as we shed old clothes that no longer serve us and replace them with new ones, our inner selves also undergo changes as we move through different stages of life. At the end of one's physical journey, the soul departs from the body much like an old garment being discarded, but this does not mean that our true self is altered in any way. Instead, it continues on its path of evolution and takes birth in a new form elsewhere.\n\nThe concept of rebirth, as explained by the Nyaya Darshan, can also be seen as a way to understand the complexities of human behavior. Babies sometimes exhibit emotions without apparent reason, which may suggest that they are recalling past experiences from previous lives. However, these memories fade as new ones are formed during childhood. The process of death and birth is also painful for the soul, causing it to forget much of its past.\n\nThe Nyaya Darshan's argument about breastfeeding in infants highlights how our past actions can influence our present experiences.

Indian philosophy has historically comprised of twelve schools of thought. Six of these accept the authority of the Vedas, and hence they are called \u0100stik Dar\u015bhans. These are M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101, Ved\u0101nt, Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015bhe\u1e63hik, S\u0101nkhya, and Yog.

Let it suffice for now to know that all these schools of thought accept the Vedas as the authority of reference. Accordingly, they all accept the eternal, unchangeable soul as the self..\nThe remaining six schools of Indian philosophy do not accept the authority of the Vedas. These are Ch\u0101rv\u0101k v\u0101da, the four Buddhist schools (Yog\u0101ch\u0101r v\u0101da, M\u0101dhyamik v\u0101da, Vaibh\u0101\u015bhik v\u0101da, and Saut\u0101ntrik v\u0101da), and Jainism. Each of these has its own explanation for the nature of the self. Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka v\u0101da states that the body itself comprises the self, and consciousness is merely a product of the conglomeration of its constituents. Jainism states that the soul is the same size as the body, and hence, it is subject to change from birth to birth. The Buddhist schools of thought do not accept the existence of a permanent soul, and instead maintain that there is a stream of renewed animation from lifetime to lifetime, which ensures continuity of the individual..\nIt seems that at the time of Shree Krishna too, versions of the Buddhist philosophy of renewed animation and non-permanence of the soul existed.

It's a valuable lesson for us to learn and apply in our personal relationships and interactions with others in today's diverse world.", "student": "In today's world, the concept of the self and its nature has been a topic of debate in various philosophical traditions. While some believe in the eternal and unchangeable soul, others argue for the idea of a constantly changing self. In the context of modern society, this verse from Bhagavad Gita encourages us to not despair even if we subscribe to the latter view.\n\nIn the verse, Shree Krishna acknowledges that Arjun may choose to believe in the philosophy of renewed animation, which suggests that the self is subject to constant birth and death. However, he urges Arjun not to grieve excessively because even within this framework, there is no reason for despair.\n\nThis verse is significant in the modern world as it highlights the importance of accepting different philosophical perspectives and finding peace within them. In today's diverse and multicultural society, we often encounter conflicting ideas about the nature of the self. Instead of getting caught up in these differences and causing ourselves unnecessary suffering, we can learn to appreciate the nuances of each philosophy and find solace in their commonalities.\n\nMoreover, this verse reminds us that even if our understanding of the self is constantly evolving, it does not mean that we should lose hope or become disheartened. Life is a journey, and our beliefs about ourselves will change as we grow and learn. By accepting this reality and embracing the present moment, we can find contentment and inner peace.\n\nIn summary, Shree Krishna's words in Bhagavad Gita encourage us to approach the concept of the self with an open mind and a sense of equanimity, regardless of our philosophical leanings. This verse serves as a reminder that even in the face of uncertainty and change, we can find solace and hope by staying grounded in our beliefs and accepting the ebbs and flows of life."}}, "2.27": {"sanskrit": " \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0939\u093f \u0927\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0935\u094b \u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0935\u0902 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e \u092e\u0943\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a |\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u093d\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 \u0928 \u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0936\u094b\u091a\u093f\u0924\u0941\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0939\u0938\u093f || 27||.\nj\u0101tasya hi dhruvo m\u1e5bityur dhruva\u1e41 janma m\u1e5bitasya chatasm\u0101d aparih\u0101rye \u2019rthe na tva\u1e41 \u015bhochitum arhasi.\njatasya hi dhruvo mrityur dhruvam janma mritasya chatasmad apariharye \u2019rthe na tvam shochitum arhasi.", "english": " Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died.

Psychologists categorize the fear of death as the biggest fear in life. In Patanjali\u2019s Yog Dar\u015bhan too, abhinive\u015bh, or the instinctive urge to survive at all costs, is mentioned as a trait of the material intellect. But for one who has taken birth, death is inevitable. So when something is inevitable, why lament over it?.\nThe Mahabharat relates an incident regarding this. During the period of their exile in the forest, one day while wandering the five Pandavas were thirsty and came across a well. Yudhishthir asked Bheem to go and fetch water for all of them. When Bheem reached the well, a yak\u1e63ha (semi-celestial being) began speaking from inside the well, \u201cI will only let you take the water if you first answer my questions.\u201d Bheem paid no heed and proceeded to draw water. The yak\u1e63ha pulled him in. After some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water. When Arjun reached the well, the yak\u1e63ha asked him too, \u201cI have already seized your brother. Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.\u201d Arjun also paid no heed, and the yak\u1e63ha pulled him into the well. The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate. Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well. Once again, the yak\u1e63ha said, \u201cAnswer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.\u201d Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions. The yak\u1e63ha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise. He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir. One of these questions was: kim \u0101\u015bhcharya\u1e41? \u201cWhat is the most surprising thing in this world?\u201d Yudhisthir replied:.\nahany ahani bh\u016bt\u0101ni gachchhant\u012bha yam\u0101layam\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101\u1e25 sthiratvam ichchhanti kim\u0101\u015bhcharyamata\u1e25 param (Mahabharat) [v30].\n\u201cAt every moment people are dying.

While modern medicine has advanced significantly, it cannot prevent death entirely. Therefore, instead of dwelling on the fear of death, a wise person should accept its inevitability and focus on living a fulfilling life in the present moment.\n\nThis verse also highlights the importance of not lamenting over things that are beyond our control. In the corporate world, this principle can be applied by accepting failures and setbacks as part of the learning process rather than dwelling on them excessively. By adopting a positive mindset and focusing on solutions instead of problems, individuals can overcome challenges and move forward with resilience and determination.\n\nIn summary, the verse encourages us to embrace the reality of death and rebirth while living our lives to the fullest in the present moment.

Just as Benjamin Franklin famously said, \"The only things certain in life are death and taxes,\" we cannot escape the fact that one day, we will all meet our end.\n\nThis verse from Bhagavad Gita encourages us to accept this truth and not waste our energy on lamentation. In the modern context, this can be seen as a reminder to prioritize what truly matters in life. We should focus on living fully in each moment, rather than constantly worrying about the future or regretting the past.\n\nIn the startup world, for example, failure is a common experience. Many entrepreneurs become so fixated on achieving success that they forget to enjoy the journey along the way. But just as death is certain for those who have been born, so too is failure inevitable for those who take risks. Instead of lamenting over this fact, we should learn to accept it and use it as an opportunity for growth.\n\nIn fact, some of the most successful entrepreneurs in history have failed multiple times before achieving success. Steve Jobs, for instance, was ousted from Apple in 1985 and went on to found NeXT Computer, which ultimately led to his return to Apple in 1997. By accepting failure as a natural part of the process, these entrepreneurs were able to learn from their mistakes and move forward with renewed determination.\n\nIn short, this verse from Bhagavad Gita reminds us that life is fleeting and uncertain, but we can choose how we respond to it. By accepting death as an inevitable part of life, we can focus on living fully in each moment and approaching failure with a sense of acceptance and resilience.", "personal": "In today's world, we often fear death and try to avoid thinking about it. However, as the Bhagavad Gita verse 2.27 reminds us, death is an inevitable part of life for those who have been born. Just like taxes are certain in life, so too is death. This realization can help us approach death with a different perspective. Instead of lamenting over something that is unavoidable, we should accept it as a natural part of the cycle of birth and rebirth. In fact, this acceptance can lead to greater peace and contentment in our lives. By recognizing that death is certain, we can focus on living each day to the fullest and making the most of the time we have.

This verse from Bhagavad Gita encourages us to accept this truth instead of lamenting over it.\n\nIn modern psychology, the instinctive urge to survive at all costs is known as abhinive\u015bh. While this trait can be helpful in certain situations, it can also lead to unnecessary fear and anxiety when we fail to acknowledge the reality that death is an inherent part of life. By accepting this truth, we can learn to live more fully and meaningfully, rather than wasting our time and energy on avoiding or denying the inevitable.\n\nIn fact, some people argue that acknowledging the inevitability of death can actually help us to live more fully in the present moment.

This can lead to a greater sense of purpose, fulfillment, and peace of mind.\n\nIn summary, this verse from Bhagavad Gita reminds us that death is an inevitable part of life, and encourages us to accept this truth rather than lamenting over it.

The cause for lamentation is only attachment that arises out of illusion.\u201d.\nIn the material realm, each individual soul is bound by three bodies\u2014gross body, subtle body, causal body..\nGross body: Consists of the five gross elements of nature\u2014earth, water, fire, air, and space..\nSubtle body: Consists of eighteen elements\u2014five life-airs, five working senses, five knowledge senses, mind, intellect, and ego..\nCausal body: Consists of the account of karmas from endless past lives, including the sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) carried forward from previous lives..\nAt the time of death, the soul discards its gross body, and departs with the subtle and causal bodies. God again gives the soul another gross body according to its subtle and causal bodies, and sends the soul into a suitable mother\u2019s womb for the purpose. After the soul gives up one gross body, there is a transitional phase before it receives a new gross body. This could be a few seconds in duration or a few years long. So before birth, the soul existed with the unmanifest subtle and causal bodies. After death, it still exists in the unmanifest state. It only becomes manifest in the middle.

This concept can help us overcome feelings of grief or attachment to material possessions or people, as we realize that everything is impermanent and will eventually pass away. It encourages us to focus on what truly matters, such as our spiritual growth and the relationships we build with others, rather than getting caught up in temporary things.

Instead of getting too attached to external factors like job titles, promotions, or material possessions, we can learn to focus on our true nature as eternal souls and find fulfillment from within. This perspective can also help us navigate difficult situations with a more positive and hopeful mindset, knowing that our true self is not affected by temporary circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the verse \"O Arjun, the soul that dwells within the body is immortal; therefore, you should not mourn for anyone\" serves as a powerful reminder to prioritize our inner well-being and spiritual growth over external achievements, and to approach life's ups and downs with a sense of detachment and equanimity.", "startup": "In today's fast-paced world, where we are constantly striving for success and growth in our careers and businesses, it's easy to get caught up in the temporary nature of material things.

However, as Shree Krishna teaches us in Bhagavad Gita, our true self or soul is immortal and eternal. This means that while our physical bodies and external circumstances may change, our inner essence remains constant.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, this teaching can be applied in several ways. Firstly, it reminds us to focus on building a strong and resilient inner self rather than being overly attached to external outcomes. This means cultivating qualities like self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-discipline, which will help us navigate through the ups and downs of life with greater ease and grace.\n\nSecondly, it encourages us to view setbacks and failures as temporary and transient, rather than permanent and catastrophic. This perspective can help us bounce back from failures more quickly and learn valuable lessons that will help us grow and improve in the long run.\n\nFinally, this teaching also reminds us of the importance of treating others with compassion and respect, recognizing that their true essence is also immortal and eternal. By cultivating empathy and kindness towards others, we can create a more positive and uplifting work environment, which will ultimately lead to greater success and fulfillment in our careers and businesses.\n\nIn summary, the verse \"O Arjun, the soul that dwells within the body is immortal; therefore, you should not mourn for anyone\" serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of focusing on our inner essence rather than external circumstances, treating others with compassion and respect, and cultivating resilience and self-discipline in the face of setbacks and failures.

Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin.\n                        .\nHaving motivated Arjun from the mundane level, Shree Krishna now moves deeper into the science of work. Arjun had expressed his fear that by killing his enemies he would incur sin. Shree Krishna addresses this apprehension. He advises Arjun to do his duty, without attachment to the fruits of his actions. Such an attitude to work will release him from any sinful reactions..\nWhen we work with selfish motives, we create karmas, which bring about their subsequent karmic reactions. The M\u0101\u1e6dhar \u015ahruti states:.\npu\u1e47yena pu\u1e47ya loka\u1e41 nayati p\u0101pena p\u0101pamubh\u0101bhy\u0101meva manu\u1e63hyalokam [v34].\n\u201cIf you do good deeds, you will go to the celestial abodes; if you do bad deeds, you will go to the nether regions; if you do a mixture of both, you will come back to the planet Earth.\u201d In either case, we get bound by the reactions of our karmas. Thus, mundane good deeds are also binding. They result in material rewards, which add to the stockpile of our karmas and thicken the illusion that there is happiness in the world..\nHowever, if we give up selfish motives, then our actions no longer create any karmic reactions. For example, murder is a sin, and the judicial law of every country of the world declares it to be a punishable offence. But if a policeman in the discharge of his duty kills the leader of a gang of bandits, he is not punished for it. If a soldier kills an enemy soldier in battle, he is not punished for it. In fact, he can even be awarded a medal for bravery. The reason for apparent lack of punishment is that these actions are not motivated by any ill-will or personal motive; they are performed as a matter of duty to the country. God\u2019s law is quite similar. If one gives up all selfish motives and works merely for the sake of duty toward the Supreme, such work does not create any karmic reactions..\nSo Shree Krishna advises Arjun to become detached from outcomes and simply focus on doing his duty. When he fights with the attitude of equanimity, treating victory and defeat, pleasure and pain as the same, then despite killing his enemies, he will never incur sin. This subject is also repeated later in the Bhagavad Gita, in verse 5.10: \u201cJust as a lotus leaf is untouched by water, those who dedicate all their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin.\u201d.\nHaving declared a profound conclusion about work without attachment, Shree Krishna now says that he will explain the science of work in detail, to reveal the logic behind what he has said..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's corporate world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita can be interpreted as follows: Instead of working solely for personal gain or success, one should prioritize fulfilling their professional responsibilities with a sense of duty and impartiality towards outcomes. This means treating both positive and negative results, such as success and failure, happiness and distress, as equally important and necessary parts of the work process. By doing so, individuals can avoid creating karmic reactions that may lead to negative consequences in the future. The key is to detach oneself from selfish motives and focus solely on completing tasks for the sake of duty towards one's organization or higher purpose.

This detachment from the fruits of our actions allows us to fulfill our responsibilities without incurring negative consequences, as we treat both success and failure, pleasure and pain, as equal opportunities for learning and growth. In other words, we should strive to do what is right and necessary, rather than focusing solely on achieving personal gains or avoiding losses.

By letting go of the need for a specific result, we can avoid getting caught up in the cycle of karma and its reactions.\n\nIn today's world, this principle is essential for achieving success while maintaining inner peace. It allows us to approach work with a sense of purpose and responsibility rather than being driven by selfish motives or external pressures. When we perform our duties without attachment, we can experience a sense of fulfillment and contentment, regardless of the outcome.\n\nMoreover, this principle is crucial for managing setbacks and failures. In a competitive world, it's easy to get disheartened by losses or disappointments. However, if we approach these situations with detachment and duty, we can learn from our mistakes and move forward without getting bogged down by negative emotions.\n\nIn summary, Shree Krishna's teachings in verse 2.38 are relevant and practical for navigating the modern world.

Its manifestation is that the mind repeatedly runs toward the object of its attachment, which could be persons, sensual objects, prestige, bodily comfort, situations, and so on. So if thoughts of some person or object repeatedly come to the mind, it is a possible indication of the mind being attached to it. However, if it is the mind that gets attached, then why is Shree Krishna bringing the intellect into the topic of attachment? Is there any role of the intellect in eliminating attachment?.\nWithin our body is the subtle anta\u1e25 kara\u1e47, which we also colloquially refer to as the heart. It consists of the mind, the intellect, and the ego. In this subtle machine, the intellect is superior to the mind. It makes decisions while the mind creates desires and gets attached to the object of affection as determined by the intellect. For instance, if the intellect decides that money is the source of happiness, the mind hankers for wealth. If the intellect decides that prestige is the most important thing in life, the mind craves for reputation and fame. In other words, the mind develops desires in accordance with the knowledge of the intellect..\nThroughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect. While sitting at home, we adopt informal postures in which the mind finds comfort. Yet, we adopt appropriate formal postures while sitting in the office. It is not that the mind enjoys the formality of the office\u2014given its way, it would rather embrace the informality of home. However, the intellect decides that formal behavior is necessary in the office. So the intellect controls the mind, and people sit formally all day long, following the decorum of the workplace, against the nature of the mind. Similarly, the mind does not enjoy doing office work\u2014if it had its way, it would rather sit at home and watch television. But the intellect rules that working in office is necessary to earn a living. Therefore, the intellect again reins in the natural tendency of the mind, and people work eight hours a day, or longer..\nThe above examples illustrate that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind. Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction. Buddhi yog is the art of detaching the mind from the fruits of actions, by developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work is meant for the pleasure of God.

The intellect plays a crucial role in shaping our thoughts and decisions, which ultimately determine our actions and outcomes. Those who have a resolute intellect, meaning they have a strong and unwavering decision-making ability, are more likely to stay focused on their goals and objectives. They have a clear vision of what they want to achieve and work diligently towards it without getting distracted by external factors or internal doubts.\n\nOn the other hand, those whose intellect is many-branched, meaning they lack clarity and focus in their thoughts and decisions, are more prone to distractions and indecisiveness. They may have multiple goals and objectives, which leads to a lack of prioritization and confusion about which path to take. This can result in wasted time, resources, and energy, as well as missed opportunities.\n\nIn the corporate world, having a resolute intellect is particularly important for success. It enables individuals to make quick and effective decisions, communicate clearly and confidently, and lead their teams with clarity and conviction.

By cultivating a resolute intellect, we can develop a single-minded focus on our goals and values, rather than being distracted by external factors.\n\nThe verse from the Bhagavad Gita, \"O descendent of the Kurus, the intellect of those who are on this path is resolute, and their aim is one-pointed. But the intellect of those who are irresolute is many-branched,\" highlights the importance of a focused and resolute intellect in eliminating attachment. Those whose intellect is many-branched, with multiple branches or directions, find their mind running in various directions, making it difficult to focus on their goals. However, those whose intellect is resolute, with a single aim or direction, are able to develop the focus of mind required to tread the path to God.\n\nIn summary, by cultivating a resolute intellect through proper knowledge and understanding, we can eliminate attachment and develop a focused and fulfilling life in today's modern world.", "student": "In today's world, attachment can manifest as a persistent thought or desire for people, possessions, experiences, or ideas. While attachment may seem natural and even desirable at times, it can also lead to negative consequences such as anxiety, stress, and distraction from our goals and values. The Bhagavad Gita teaches that the intellect plays a crucial role in managing attachment.\n\nThe intellect is a higher faculty of the mind that makes decisions based on knowledge and understanding. It guides the mind in its desires and actions. In this sense, the intellect is superior to the mind, which creates desires and gets attached to objects as determined by the intellect. For example, if the intellect decides that wealth brings happiness, the mind will crave for material possessions.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita emphasizes that cultivating a resolute intellect is essential in managing attachment. A person with a resolute intellect has a clear and focused aim, and their thoughts are not scattered or confused. In contrast, those with an irresolute intellect have many-branched thoughts and find it difficult to focus on a single goal.\n\nIn our daily lives, we use our intellect to control the mind. We may adopt different postures or behaviors in different situations based on what is appropriate or necessary. For example, we may sit formally at work but informally at home. The intellect guides us in making these decisions and helps us manage our thoughts and actions.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita teaches that developing a resolute intellect requires cultivating the decision to perform all actions for the pleasure of God. This decision becomes so strong in higher stages of spiritual practice that it overcomes all obstacles and distractions. Such a person has a single-minded focus on their goal, like an arrow released from a bow.\n\nIn conclusion, attachment is a natural tendency of the mind, but it can be managed through the intellect. Cultivating a resolute intellect requires developing a clear aim and decision to perform all actions for the pleasure of God. This helps us manage our thoughts and actions in a way that promotes our spiritual growth and well-being."}}, "2.42-43": {"sanskrit": " \u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u091a\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0926\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093f\u092a\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924: |\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0930\u0924\u093e: \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0928\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0926\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0924\u093f \u0935\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0928: || 42||\u0915\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928: \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917\u092a\u0930\u093e \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092b\u0932\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u092e\u094d |\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u092c\u0939\u0941\u0932\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u094b\u0917\u0948\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0917\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f || 43||.\ny\u0101mim\u0101\u1e41 pu\u1e63hpit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101cha\u1e41 pravadanty-avipa\u015bhchita\u1e25veda-v\u0101da-rat\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha n\u0101nyad ast\u012bti v\u0101dina\u1e25k\u0101m\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25 swarga-par\u0101 janma-karma-phala-prad\u0101mkriy\u0101-vi\u015bhe\u1e63ha-bahul\u0101\u1e41 bhogai\u015bhwarya-gati\u1e41 prati.\nyamimam pushpitam vacham pravadanty-avipashchitahveda-vada-ratah partha nanyad astiti vadinahkamatmanah swarga-para janma-karma-phala-pradamkriya-vishesha-bahulam bhogaishwarya-gatim prati.", "english": " Those with limited understanding, get attracted to the flowery words of the Vedas, which advocate ostentatious rituals for elevation to the celestial abodes, and presume no higher principle is described in them.

However, just as a small well serves its immediate purpose, it may not provide all the resources needed for long-term growth and sustainability.

However, just as the Vedas provided material allurements to attract people, many of these resources also offer immediate gratification and temporary solutions without addressing the underlying issues.\n\nTo truly fulfill the purpose of all these resources, one needs to understand their underlying motive and reject any intermediate instructions that do not align with the ultimate goal of realizing God or the ultimate truth. This requires a deep introspection and detachment from material desires, which can be achieved through spiritual practices like meditation, prayer, and selfless service.\n\nIn summary, just as a small well serves its immediate purpose but a large body of water fulfills all needs, in the modern world, one should seek knowledge and practices that provide long-term fulfillment by understanding their underlying motive and rejecting any intermediate instructions that do not align with the ultimate goal.", "startup": "The verse \"Whatever purpose is served by a small well of water is naturally served in all respects by a large lake\" can be interpreted in the context of modern life as follows: Just as a small well may provide limited resources for drinking, washing, and irrigation, a larger body of water like a lake serves multiple purposes such as providing drinking water, facilitating transportation, supporting aquatic life, and generating hydroelectric power. Similarly, in the spiritual realm, realizing the Absolute Truth or God through practices like meditation, prayer, and selfless service fulfills all the purposes served by following various religious texts like the Vedas. The ultimate goal of these texts is to help individuals connect with God and lead a fulfilling life.

Those who understand this purpose and wholeheartedly follow it are considered the highest devotees by Shree Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.

Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.\n                        .\nThis is an extremely popular verse of the Bhagavad Gita, so much so that even most school children in India are familiar with it. It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted whenever the topic of karm yog is discussed. The verse gives four instructions regarding the science of work: 1) Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. 2) The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. 3) Even while working, give up the pride of doership. 4) Do not be attached to inaction..\nDo your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. We have the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. A number of factors come into play in determining the results\u2014our efforts, destiny (our past karmas), the will of God, the efforts of others, the cumulative karmas of the people involved, the place and situation (a matter of luck), etc. Now if we become anxious for results, we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job. The fact is that when we are unconcerned about the results, we are able to focus entirely on our efforts, and the result is even better than before..\nA humorous acronym for this is NATO or Not Attached to Outcome. Consider its application to a simple everyday activity such as playing golf. When people play golf, they are engrossed in the fruits\u2014whether their score is under par, over par, etc. Now if they could merely focus on playing the shots to the best of their ability, they would find it the most enjoyable game of golf they have ever played. Additionally, with their complete focus on the shot being played, their game would be raised to a higher level..\nThe fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. To perform actions is an integral part of human nature. Having come into this world, we all have various duties determined by our family situation, social position, occupation, etc. While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results\u2014the results are meant for the pleasure of God. The individual soul is a tiny part of God (verse 15.7), and hence our inherent nature is to serve him through all our actions..\nd\u0101sa bh\u016btamida\u1e41 tasya jagatsth\u0101vara jangamam\u015bhr\u012bmann\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a sw\u0101m\u012b jagat\u0101\u1e41prabhur\u012b\u015bhwara\u1e25 (Padma Puran)[v40].\n\u201cGod is the Master of the entire creation; all moving and non-moving beings are his servants.\u201d Material consciousness is characterized by the following manner of thoughts, \u201cI am the proprietor of all that I possess. It is all meant for my enjoyment. I have the right to enhance my possessions and maximize my enjoyment.\u201d The reverse of this is Spiritual consciousness, which is characterized by thoughts such as, \u201cGod is the owner and enjoyer of this entire world. I am merely his selfless servant. I must use all that I have in the service of God.\u201d Accordingly, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun not to think of himself as the enjoyer of the fruits of his actions..\nEven while working, give up the pride of doership. Shree Krishna wants Arjun to give up kartritw\u0101bhim\u0101n, or the ego of being the doer. He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions. However, when we perform actions, then why should we not consider ourselves as the doers of those actions? The reason is that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our disposal. As a result, only with the help of the power we receive from him, are we able to work. For example, the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves, but they get energized by someone\u2019s hand, and then they perform even difficult tasks, such as lifting burning coal, etc. Now if we say that the tongs are the doers of actions, it will be inaccurate. If the hand did not energize them, what would they be able to do? They would merely lie inert on the table. Similarly, if God did not supply our body-mind-soul mechanism with the power to perform actions, we could have done nothing. Thus, we must give up the ego of doing, remembering that God is the only source of the power by which we perform all our actions..\nAll the above thoughts are very nicely summarized in the following popular Sanskrit verse:.\nyatk\u1e5bita\u1e41 yatkari\u1e63hy\u0101mi tatsarva\u1e41 na may\u0101 k\u1e5bitamtvay\u0101 k\u1e5bita\u1e41 tu phalabhuk tvameva madhus\u016bdana [v41].\n\u201cWhatever I have achieved and whatever I wish to achieve, I am not the doer of these. O Madhusudan, you are the real doer, and you alone are the enjoyer of their results.\u201d.\nDo not be attached to inaction. Although the nature of the living being is to work, often situations arise where work seems burdensome and confusing. In such cases, instead of running away from it, we must understand and implement the proper science of work, as explained by Shree Krishna to Arjun. However, it is highly inappropriate if we consider work as laborious and burdensome, and resort to inaction. Becoming attached to inaction is never the solution and is clearly condemned by Shree Krishna..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, the teachings of Bhagvad Gita's verse 2.47 hold immense relevance.

However, Verse 2.47 offers timeless insights that can help us navigate the complexities of work and achieve a healthy balance between action and detachment.\n\nFirstly, we have the right to perform our duties, but we should not be attached to the results. This means that we should focus on doing our best in every task, without worrying about the outcome. We must understand that various factors contribute to the results of our actions, and we cannot control everything. By detaching ourselves from the results, we can reduce stress and anxiety, and instead, enjoy the process of working.\n\nSecondly, the fruits of our actions are not for our enjoyment. This does not mean that we should not strive for success or rewards, but rather, we should remember that everything belongs to God, and we are merely His servants. Our ultimate goal should be to serve Him through our work, and any material gains should be seen as a means to further this purpose.\n\nThirdly, while working, we should give up the pride of doership. This does not mean that we should not take responsibility for our actions or decisions, but rather, we should recognize that it is God who empowers us to work. We must remember that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert, and it is only through His power that we can perform any action. By giving up the ego of doing, we can reduce arrogance and pride, which can hinder our growth and progress.\n\nLastly, we should not be attached to inaction. While it is essential to take breaks and rest when needed, we must understand that work is a natural part of our existence. Avoiding work out of fear or laziness is not the solution. Instead, we should learn how to work effectively and efficiently, without getting overwhelmed or burnt out.

In a highly competitive and result-oriented society, it can be easy to get caught up in the desire for success and recognition. However, this verse reminds us that we have a duty to perform, but we should not be attached to the outcomes.\n\nThe first instruction given by Shree Krishna is to do our duty without worrying about the results. This means focusing on the process rather than the outcome. When we are fully engaged in our work and give it our best effort, the results will follow naturally. By detaching ourselves from the need for a specific result, we can also reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nThe second instruction is that the fruits of our actions are not meant for our enjoyment. This teaches us to approach our work with a sense of service rather than selfishness. We should strive to do our best in all our endeavors, but ultimately, it is not about what we can gain from it, but rather how we can contribute to society and serve others.\n\nThe third instruction is to give up the ego of being the doer. This means recognizing that everything we accomplish is due to the divine power that energizes us. We should approach our work with humility and gratitude, acknowledging that all success comes from a higher source.\n\nFinally, Shree Krishna advises us not to be attached to inaction. While it can be tempting to avoid difficult tasks or situations, this verse encourages us to face challenges head-on and approach them with the proper science of work.

This does not mean that we should stop striving for success or that we shouldn't enjoy the rewards of our hard work. It simply means that we should remember that everything belongs to God, and we are merely His servants. By recognizing this, we can approach our work with a sense of gratitude and humility, rather than selfishness or entitlement.\n\nThe third instruction is to give up the pride of doership. In today's society, where self-promotion and individualism are highly valued, it can be difficult to let go of this ego. However, by recognizing that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert without God's power, we can approach our work with a sense of detachment and surrender. This does not mean that we should stop taking responsibility for our actions or stop believing in ourselves. It simply means that we should remember that everything is possible only through the grace of God.\n\nThe fourth instruction is to avoid attachment to inaction. In today's world, where stress and burnout are common issues, it can be tempting to avoid work altogether. However, by understanding the proper science of work as explained by Shree Krishna, we can approach our tasks with a sense of balance and harmony.

Miserly are those who seek to enjoy the fruits of their works.\n                        .\nThere are two aspects to work: 1) The external activity we do, 2) Our internal attitude toward it. For example, let us say that a temple is being built in the holy land of Vrindavan. The workers are engaged in a sacred activity, but their attitude is mundane. They are concerned with the salary they receive. If another contractor offers higher wages, they will not mind switching their job. There is also an ascetic living in Vrindavan, who, seeing the glorious temple being built, engages in k\u0101r sev\u0101 (voluntary work) as a service to God. The external work performed by the sadhu and the workers are the same, but the internal attitudes are poles apart..\nHere Shree Krishna advises Arjun to move higher in his internal motivation toward work. He declares that those who work with the motivation of self-enjoyment are miserly. Those who are detached from the fruits and dedicate their work to a higher cause are superior. And those who offer the fruits to God are truly in knowledge..\nThe word k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a (miserly) has been used here.

Bill Gates, having renounced his position in Microsoft Corporation, now dedicates his energy in the service of society. Similarly, after having had his fill of power and position as the President of USA, Bill Clinton now preaches the glories of service to humankind, and has even written a book on the topic, \u201cGiving\u2014How Each Of Us Can Change The World.\u201d Their engagement in service is praiseworthy, but it is still imperfectly oriented.

Those who are solely motivated by self-interest and seek enjoyment from their work are considered miserly because they fail to recognize the true value of service and sacrifice. On the other hand, individuals who offer their work as a service to a higher cause or dedicate it to God are superior in knowledge. As we evolve spiritually, we should strive towards shedding our attachment to personal rewards and instead, focus on serving others selflessly.

However, true fulfillment comes from working with a higher purpose in mind. For example, consider two individuals working for a non-profit organization.

Shree Krishna explains that working without personal motivation does not reduce the quality of our work; instead we become even more skillful than before. Consider the example of a sincere surgeon who cuts people with his knife while operating upon them. He performs his duty with equanimity, and is undisturbed irrespective of whether the patient survives or dies. This is because he is merely doing his duty unselfishly, to the best of his ability, and is not attached to the results. Hence, even if the patient dies while being operated upon, the surgeon does not feel guilty of murder. However, if the same surgeon\u2019s only child needs to be operated, he does not have the courage to do so. Because of attachment to the results, he fears he will not be able to perform the operation skillfully, and so he seeks the help of another surgeon. This shows that attachment to results does not make us more skillful; rather, the attachment affects our performance adversely. Instead, if we work without attachment, we can do so at our maximum skill level, without feeling nervous, jittery, scared, tense, or excited..\nLikewise, Arjun\u2019s personal example also illustrates the point that giving up attachment to the fruits does not adversely affect performance. Before hearing the Bhagavad Gita, he intended to engage in war with the desire of winning a kingdom. After hearing the Bhagavad Gita from Shree Krishna, he was fighting because it was his duty to God, and Shree Krishna would be pleased by it. He was still a warrior; however, his internal motivation had changed. The fact that he did his duty without attachment did not make him any less competent than before. In fact, he fought with greater inspiration because his work was directly in service of God..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "Verse 2.50 in the context of the modern world encourages us to approach our work with detachment and focus on doing it skillfully rather than being attached to the outcomes.

The verse from Bhagavad Gita, \"One who prudently practices the science of work without attachment can get rid of both good and bad reactions in this life itself. Therefore, strive for Yog, which is the art of working skillfully (in proper consciousness)\" highlights the importance of detachment in achieving success in our endeavors.\n\nIn the context of modern-day startups, this verse means that entrepreneurs who focus on doing their work diligently without being attached to the outcome will be able to overcome both positive and negative consequences in their current life itself. This is because when we are attached to the results, it leads to stress, anxiety, and fear, which can negatively impact our performance. On the other hand, if we approach our work with detachment, we can remain calm, focused, and skilled, irrespective of whether the outcome is favorable or not.\n\nFor instance, a startup founder who is attached to the success of their product may become overly invested in its outcome, leading to excessive stress and anxiety. This attachment can lead to poor decision-making, which could negatively impact the company's growth prospects. However, if this same founder approaches their work with detachment, they will be able to make rational decisions based on the facts at hand, without being swayed by emotions or personal motivations.\n\nIn summary, practicing karma yoga in the modern world can lead to greater success and fulfillment in our professional endeavors.

In today's fast-paced and competitive society, people often become too attached to the outcomes of their work, leading to stress, anxiety, and disappointment when things do not go according to plan. However, practicing the science of karma yoga, or selfless action, can help us overcome these negative reactions.\n\nBy working without attachment, we are able to focus solely on doing our duty to the best of our abilities, rather than being driven by personal motives or desires for recognition or reward. This allows us to approach our work with a clear and focused mindset, which in turn leads to greater skill and efficiency. We are better equipped to handle setbacks and failures, as we are not overly invested in the outcome. Instead, we view them as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as personal failures or shortcomings.\n\nIn the modern world, this principle can be applied to various aspects of our lives, from our professional careers to our personal relationships.

In a highly competitive and results-oriented society, it can be challenging to separate our personal desires and expectations from our professional pursuits. However, practicing karm-yog, or the science of work, without attachment can lead to several benefits in our modern context.\n\nFirstly, it helps us to focus on the process rather than the outcome. When we are attached to the results, we tend to get anxious, stressed, and overwhelmed by the pressure to succeed. This mindset can hinder our performance as we may make mistakes due to nervousness or lack of concentration. On the other hand, when we approach work with detachment, we can remain calm, composed, and focused on doing our best without worrying about the outcome.\n\nSecondly, it helps us to be more skillful and efficient in our work. When we are not attached to the results, we can approach tasks with a clear mind and a sense of purpose. We can give our full attention and energy to the task at hand, which allows us to perform better than when we are distracted by personal goals or expectations. This detachment also helps us to be more adaptable and flexible in our work as we can adjust our approach based on the situation rather than being rigidly attached to a particular outcome.\n\nThirdly, it helps us to cultivate a sense of responsibility and duty towards our work. When we are not attached to the results, we can view our work as a service to others or society rather than just a means to an end. This shift in perspective can give us a greater sense of fulfillment and satisfaction from our work, regardless of whether it leads to immediate rewards or recognition.\n\nIn summary, practicing karm-yog without attachment can lead to greater skillfulness, efficiency, responsibility, and detachment from the results.

This blind pursuit has been going on for many lifetimes and yet there is no sight of happiness.

Each fragment is naturally drawn towards its whole; just as a piece of stone is drawn by the force of gravitation towards the earth. The individual soul is a fragment of God, who is infinite bliss. Hence, the soul is a fragment of the ocean of infinite bliss, and it experiences the natural urge for bliss. When it strives to relish the bliss of the soul from God, it is called \u201cDivine Love.\u201d But when, in ignorance of its spiritual nature, it thinks of itself as the body, and seeks to relish the bliss of the body from the world, it is called \u201clust.\u201d.\nThis world has been called m\u1e5biga t\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47\u0101 in the scriptures, meaning \u201clike the mirage seen by the deer.\u201d The sun rays reflecting on the hot desert sand create an illusion of water for the deer. It thinks there is water ahead of it and runs to quench its thirst. But the more it runs toward the water, the more the mirage fades away. Its dull intellect cannot recognize that it is running after an illusion. The unfortunate deer keeps chasing the illusory water and dies of exhaustion on the desert sand. Similarly, the material energy Maya too creates an illusion of happiness, and we run after that illusory happiness in the hope of quenching the thirst of our senses. But no matter how much we try, happiness keeps fading further away from us.

In the context of the corporate world, this can lead to increased productivity, better decision-making abilities, and a more positive work environment as individuals become less reactive to stressors and more focused on achieving long-term goals.

If one permits the mind to brood over miseries, then the contemplation on the divine ceases and the mind is dragged down from the transcendental level. The process of torture works in the same manner. More than the present pain itself, it is the memories of past pain and apprehensions of future pain that torment the mind. But when the mind drops these two and has to simply grope with the present sensation, the pain surprisingly shrinks to a manageable (within the limits of tolerance) size. It is well known that historically Buddhist monks adopted a similar technique for tolerating torture from invading conquerors..\nSimilarly, if the mind craves external pleasures, it runs to the objects of enjoyment, and is again diverted from divine contemplation. So a sage of steady wisdom is one who does not allow the mind to hanker for pleasure or lament for miseries. Further, such a sage does not permit the mind to succumb to the urges of fear and anger.

In today's world, we are constantly bombarded with advertisements and social media influencers promoting products and experiences that promise happiness and fulfillment. However, these pleasures are often temporary and leave us wanting more. A sage of steady wisdom understands that true happiness comes from within and is not dependent on external factors. They learn to find contentment in simple things and avoid getting caught up in the pursuit of fleeting pleasures.\n\nAnother aspect of being a sage of steady wisdom is remaining free from fear. In the corporate world, there are many sources of fear - fear of failure, fear of competition, fear of losing one's job. However, a sage of steady wisdom understands that these fears are illusory and do not serve them in any way. They learn to face their fears head-on and approach challenges with a calm and composed mindset.\n\nLastly, a sage of steady wisdom is free from anger. In the corporate world, there can be many sources of anger - frustration with colleagues, disappointment with results, etc. However, a sage of steady wisdom understands that anger only leads to negative consequences and does not serve them in any way. They learn to approach conflicts with a level head and seek peaceful solutions rather than resorting to anger or aggression.\n\nIn summary, being a sage of steady wisdom in the modern world requires giving up cravings for pleasure, remaining free from fear, and being free from anger.

However, Shree Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita provide us with practical guidance on how to cultivate inner peace and focus on our spiritual growth.\n\nThe verse we are discussing today, 2.56, describes a sage who possesses steady wisdom as someone whose mind remains undisturbed amidst misery, does not crave for pleasure, and is free from attachment, fear, and anger. In other words, this person has learned to detach themselves from material desires, overcome their fears, and manage their emotions in a healthy way.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, this verse can be interpreted as follows: A successful entrepreneur or business leader who embodies steady wisdom is someone who remains calm and focused during times of crisis, does not prioritize short-term pleasures over long-term goals, and is not driven by attachment, fear, or anger. Instead, they maintain a clear vision for their company's mission and values, and make decisions based on sound judgment and intuition rather than impulsive reactions.\n\nIn today's startup world, where competition is fierce and failure rates are high, it can be easy to get caught up in the pursuit of quick success and external validation.

However, understanding and applying the teachings of Bhagavad Gita in our daily lives is essential for achieving inner peace and contentment.\n\nThe verse we're discussing today, 2.56, highlights three key characteristics of such a wise person: they remain undisturbed amidst misery, do not crave for pleasure, and are free from attachment, fear, and anger. Let's explore each of these qualities in the context of modern life.\n\nFirstly, remaining undisturbed amidst misery is a crucial trait that separates a sage with steady wisdom from the rest of us. In today's world, we often react strongly to negative situations, allowing them to consume our thoughts and emotions. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and even depression. However, a sage remains calm and composed in the face of adversity, recognizing that misery is an inherent part of life and accepting it with equanimity. This does not mean that they ignore or dismiss their problems; instead, they approach them with a clear and rational mind, seeking solutions rather than getting bogged down by negative emotions.\n\nSecondly, the sage does not crave for pleasure. In today's society, we are constantly bombarded with messages about material pleasures and happiness. We are led to believe that acquiring more possessions or experiences will lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment. However, this is a fallacy. True happiness comes from within, not from external sources. A sage recognizes this truth and does not allow themselves to be swayed by fleeting pleasures. Instead, they seek inner contentment and peace, understanding that true happiness cannot be found in material possessions or experiences alone.\n\nFinally, the sage is free from attachment, fear, and anger. In today's world, we often become attached to people, things, and ideas, leading to suffering when these attachments are threatened or lost. We also frequently succumb to fear and anger, allowing these emotions to cloud our judgment and lead us down destructive paths. A sage recognizes the futility of attachment, fear, and anger and strives to remain detached from external influences, freeing themselves from unnecessary suffering.\n\nIn summary, a sage with steady wisdom is someone who remains undisturbed amidst misery, does not crave for pleasure, and is free from attachment, fear, and anger. By cultivating these qualities in our daily lives, we can achieve inner peace, contentment, and spiritual growth, even in the midst of a fast-paced and often chaotic modern world."}}, "2.57": {"sanskrit": " \u092f: \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u092d\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0928\u0947\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f \u0936\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0936\u0941\u092d\u092e\u094d |\u0928\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0924\u093f \u0928 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093f\u0924\u093e || 57||.\nya\u1e25 sarvatr\u0101nabhisnehas tat tat pr\u0101pya \u015bhubh\u0101\u015bhubhamn\u0101bhinandati na dve\u1e63h\u1e6di tasya praj\u00f1\u0101 prati\u1e63h\u1e6dhit\u0101.\nyah sarvatranabhisnehas tat tat prapya shubhashubhamnabhinandati na dveshti tasya prajna pratishthita.", "english": " One who remains unattached under all conditions, and is neither delighted by good fortune nor dejected by tribulation, he is a sage with perfect knowledge.\n                        .\nRudyard Kipling, a famous British poet, has encapsulated the essence of this verse on Sthita praj\u00f1a (Sage of steady intelligence) in his famous poem \u201cIf.\u201d Here are a few lines from the poem:.\nIf you can dream\u2014and not make dreams your master;If you can think\u2014and not make thoughts your aim,If you can meet with Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two impostors just the same\u2026If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,If all men count with you, but none too much:If you can fill the unforgiving minuteWith sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it,And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a Man, my son!.\nThe popularity of this poem shows the natural urge in people to reach the state of enlightenment, which Shree Krishna describes to Arjun.

The same logic applies to desires as well. The mind and senses throw up myriad desires for happiness, but as long as we are in the game of fulfilling them, happiness remains illusory, like the mirage. But when we learn to discard all these desires, to find happiness in God, the mind and senses make peace with us..\nSo an enlightened sage intelligently masters the senses and the mind. The illustration used in this verse is that of the turtle. Whenever it encounters danger, the turtle protects itself by drawing its limbs and head inside its shell.

Therefore, those desirous of spiritual growth should carefully strive to tame the indulgent senses, which are colored with lust and greed, or else they have the power to sabotage and derail the spiritual process of even the most well-intentioned yogis..\nThe \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam relates a story that perfectly illustrates this statement (canto 9, chapter 6). There was a great sage in ancient times, known as Saubhari. He is mentioned in the Rig Veda, where there is a mantra called Saubhari Sutra. There is also a scripture called the Saubhari Samhita. So he was not just an ordinary sage. Saubhari had attained such control over his body that he used to submerge himself in the river Yamuna and meditate under water. One day, he saw two fish mating. This sight carried away his mind and senses, and the desire for sexual association arose in him. He abandoned his spiritual practice and came out of the water, wondering how to fulfill his desire..\nAt that time, the king of Ayodhya was Mandhata, who was a very illustrious and noble ruler. He had fifty daughters, each more beautiful than the other. Saubhari approached the king and asked for the hand of one of the fifty princesses..\nKing Mandhata wondered about the sanity of the sage and thought to himself, \u201cAn old man wanting to get married!\u201d The king knew Saubhari to be a powerful sage, and feared that if he refused, the sage might curse him. But if he consented, the life of one of his daughters would be ruined. He was in a dilemma. So he said, \u201cO holy one! I have no objection to your request. Please take a seat. I shall bring my fifty daughters before you, and whosoever chooses you will become yours in marriage.\u201d The king was confident that none of his daughters would choose the old ascetic, and in this way, he would be saved from the sage\u2019s curse..\nSaubhari was all too aware of the king\u2019s intention. He told the king that he would return the following day. That evening, he used his yogic powers to turn himself into a handsome young man. Consequently, when he presented himself at the palace the next day, all the fifty princesses chose him as their husband. The king was bound by the word he had given and was compelled to marry all his daughters to the sage..\nNow the king was concerned about the fights that would take place amongst the fifty sisters, since they would have to share a husband. However, Saubhari again used his yogic powers. Putting the king\u2019s apprehension to rest, he assumed fifty forms and created fifty palaces for his wives, and lived separately with each one of them. In this manner, thousands of years passed by. The Puranas state that Saubhari had many children from each of them, and those children had further children, until a tiny city had been created. One day, Saubhari came to his senses, and exclaimed, aho ima\u1e41 pa\u015bhyata me vin\u0101\u015bha\u1e41 (Bh\u0101gavatam 9.6.50) [v51] \u201cO humans!

Our desires for material possessions, power, and success can become overwhelming, leading us away from our spiritual path. The modern-day equivalent of Saubhari's story is the allure of wealth and status in the corporate world.

In today's fast-paced, materialistic society, our senses are constantly bombarded with stimuli that can easily overpower our mind and lead us astray from our spiritual path. The desire for pleasure, comfort, and success can become all-consuming, causing us to lose sight of our true purpose and values.\n\nJust as the sage Saubhari in the Bhagavatam story was seduced by his senses and lost his way, we too must be cautious of their power.

Our senses can easily become addicted to these pleasures, causing us to lose focus on our spiritual path. This is where the practice of self-control comes in. By learning to discipline our senses, we can prevent them from leading us astray and instead channel them towards our higher goals.\n\nThe story of Saubhari in the Bhagavatam illustrates this concept perfectly. Saubhari was a powerful sage who had attained control over his body through spiritual practice.

This led him to abandon his practice and seek marriage with one of King Mandhata's fifty daughters.\n\nKing Mandhata was aware of Saubhari's intentions but feared that refusing would lead to a curse.

We must learn to discipline our senses and not let them lead us astray from our spiritual path. By practicing self-control, we can prevent our senses from becoming addicted to material pleasures and instead focus on our higher goals.

Attachment leads to desire, and from desire arises anger.\n                        .\nAnger, greed, lust, etc. are considered in the Vedic scriptures as m\u0101nas rog, or diseases of the mind. The Ramayan states: m\u0101nas roga kachhuka mai\u1e45 g\u0101e hahi\u1e45 saba ke\u1e45 lakhi biralenha p\u0101e [v53] We are all aware of the diseases of the body\u2014even a single bodily ailment has the power to make one\u2019s whole day miserable\u2014but we do not realize that we are being continuously tormented by multiple mental ailments. And since we do not recognize lust, anger, greed, etc. as mental diseases, we do not try to cure them. Psychology is a branch of human knowledge that attempts to analyze these ailments and propose solutions to them. However, both the analysis and the solution presented by western psychology leave much to be desired, and appear to be gross approximations of the reality of the mind..\nIn this and the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna has given perfect and penetrating insight into functioning of the mind. He explains that when we repeatedly contemplate that there is happiness in some object, the mind becomes attached to it. For example, in a class there are a number of boys and girls, and they interact innocuously with each other. One day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, \u201cI would be very happy if she were mine.\u201d As he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her. He tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her. His friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her. Why is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her? The fact is that he repeatedly thought that there was happiness in the girl, and so his mind became attached to her..\nNow attachment seems quite innocuous by itself. But the problem is that from attachment comes desire. If one is attached to drinks, the desire for drinks comes repeatedly to the mind. If one is attached to cigarettes, then thoughts of the pleasure of smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow in the mind, creating a craving for them. In this way, attachment leads to desire..\nOnce desire develops, it gives birth to two more problems\u2014greed and anger. Greed comes from the fulfillment of desire. Jimi pratil\u0101bha lobha adhik\u0101\u012b (Ramayan) [v54] \u201cIf you satisfy desire, it leads to greed.\u201d Thus desire is never eliminated by satiating it:.\nyat p\u1e5bithivy\u0101\u1e41 vr\u012bhi-yava\u1e41 hira\u1e47ya\u1e41 pa\u015bhava\u1e25 striya\u1e25na duhyanti mana\u1e25-pr\u012bti\u1e41 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u0101ma-hatasya te (Bh\u0101gavatam 9.19.13) [v55].\n\u201cIf one person were to get all the wealth, luxuries, and sensual objects in the world, that person\u2019s desire would still not be satiated. Hence, knowing it to be the cause of misery, an intelligent person should renounce desire.\u201d.\nOn the flip side what happens if the fulfillment of desire is obstructed? It gives rise to anger. Bear in mind that anger does not arise by itself. It is created from the obstruction of desire; and desire arises from attachment, while attachment comes from contemplation of the sense objects. In this manner, we see how the simple act of contemplating the pleasures of sense objects leads downward to the twin diseases of greed and anger. In the next verse Shree Krishna continues the chain further down, and explains the consequences of anger..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, the verse \"While contemplating on the objects of the senses, one develops attachment to them. Attachment leads to desire, and from desire arises anger\" holds true in many ways. In a highly competitive work environment, individuals may become attached to certain projects, promotions, or colleagues, leading to desires for success and recognition. However, when these desires are not fulfilled, it can result in anger and frustration, causing strained relationships with coworkers and managers. This verse highlights the importance of managing our thoughts and desires to avoid negative emotions that can hinder productivity and professional relationships. It encourages individuals to focus on their work and goals without becoming too attached or fixated on external factors, ultimately leading to a more peaceful and successful career path.", "startup": "In today's fast-paced world, where technology and material possessions seem to be the key to success, it's easy to get caught up in the pleasures of the senses. We see something we desire, whether it's a new gadget or a luxurious vacation, and our minds become attached to it. This attachment leads to a strong desire for that object, which can then give rise to greed and anger if our desires are not fulfilled.\n\nIn the context of startups, this concept is especially relevant. Entrepreneurs often become attached to their ideas or products, leading to a strong desire for success. However, if they encounter obstacles or setbacks, that desire can turn into anger and frustration. This can negatively impact their decision-making abilities and hinder the growth of their business.\n\nTo avoid falling into this trap, it's important to cultivate detachment and renounce desire. Instead of focusing solely on material success, entrepreneurs should strive for a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment. By doing so, they can navigate the ups and downs of the startup world with greater ease and resilience.\n\nIn summary, Shree Krishna's teachings in Bhagvad Gita provide valuable insights into the functioning of the mind and the dangers of attachment, desire, greed, and anger. By understanding these concepts and applying them to our daily lives, we can cultivate a more balanced and fulfilling existence, both personally and professionally.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse can be interpreted as follows:\n\nVerse 2.62 (modern interpretation): When we repeatedly think that there is happiness in certain things or experiences, such as material possessions, relationships, or achievements, we develop attachment towards them.

For example, if we constantly crave for a particular item or person, our mind becomes attached to it, leading to strong desires and intense feelings of greed and anger when we are unable to fulfill those desires. This chain of thoughts and emotions can have negative consequences on our mental and emotional well-being, as well as our relationships with others. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of this cycle and strive to cultivate detachment and contentment in order to avoid the mental diseases of greed and anger.", "student": "In today's world, this verse can be interpreted as follows:\n\nVerse 2.62 (in modern context): While constantly focusing on material pleasures and desires, one develops attachment towards them.

Now, the urge for happiness is as natural to the soul as thirst is to the physical body. It is impossible to think \u201cI will not contemplate happiness anywhere,\u201d because it is unnatural for the soul. The simple solution then is to envision happiness in the proper direction, i.e. in God. If we can repeatedly revise the thought that happiness is in God, we will develop attachment toward him. This divine attachment will not degrade the mind like material attachment; rather, it will purify it. God is all-pure, and when we attach our mind to him, the mind will also become pure..\nThus, whenever Shree Krishna asks us to give up attachment and desire, he is referring only to material attachment and desire. Spiritual attachment and desire are not to be given up; in fact, they are most praiseworthy. They are to be cultivated and increased for purification of the mind. The greater the burning desire we develop for God, the purer our mind will become. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who propound the worship of the undifferentiated attributeless Brahman do not understand this point when they recommend giving up all attachments. However, Shree Krishna states: \u201cThose who attach their minds to me with unadulterated devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and attain the level of the supreme Brahman.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 14.26) He repeatedly urges Arjun to attach his mind to God in many verses ahead, such as 8.7, 8.14, 9.22, 9.34, 10.10, 12.8, 11.54, 18.55, 18.58, 18.65, etc..\nAttachment and aversion are two sides of the same coin. Aversion is nothing but negative attachment. Just as, in attachment, the object of attachment repeatedly comes to one\u2019s mind; similarly, in aversion, the object of hatred keeps popping into the mind. So attachment and aversion to material objects both have the same effect on the mind\u2014they dirty it and pull it into the three modes of material nature. When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss. On experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them. Thus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita praj\u00f1a is free from both attachment and aversion..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, where success and happiness are often measured by material gains, it can be challenging to detach oneself from the constant pursuit of sense objects.

We might also be lured in by the desire for food, like fish who swallow bait, or by the touch of something appealing, as elephants can be enticed into pits by the presence of females.\n\nIn our modern world, we are constantly bombarded with sensory stimuli - from the sound of notifications on our phones to the sight of advertisements and the smell of delicious food. It's easy to get caught up in these distractions and lose sight of what truly matters.\n\nShree Krishna warns Arjun that just as these senses can lead other animals to their demise, they have the power to do the same for us. We must be mindful of our senses and learn to control them, rather than letting them control us. By doing so, we can stay focused on our goals and avoid getting sidetracked by external distractions.", "student": "In today's world, we can relate to this verse as our senses, especially those that are overindulged, have the potential to distract us from our goals and lead us astray.

In this age of technology, for example, the constant notifications and alerts on our phones can distract us from our work or studies, leading to a loss of productivity and focus. It's essential to cultivate self-discipline and learn to control our senses, rather than letting them control us.

People often confuse the meaning of this verse by taking the words literally. There was once a Khade Shree Baba (the standing ascetic), whose disciples claimed he was a very big sage. He had not slept in thirty-five years. He would stand in his room, resting on a hanging rope under his armpits. He used the rope to help him remain in the standing position.

This requires a sense of humility and an understanding that everyone has their own unique path in life.\n\nProprietorship: The feeling of ownership over things can also hinder our inner peace. We often forget that everything in this world belongs to God, and we are just temporary custodians. To find peace, we need to let go of the attachment we have towards material possessions and understand that they are not truly ours. This requires a sense of detachment and an understanding that everything is transient.\n\nIn conclusion, finding inner peace in today's world requires us to let go of our desires, greed, egoism, and proprietorship. By learning to be content with what we have, accepting others as they are, and letting go of attachment towards material possessions, we can achieve a sense of inner peace that is essential for our overall well-being."}}, "2.72": {"sanskrit": " \u090f\u0937\u093e \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093f: \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0928\u0948\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f \u0935\u093f\u092e\u0941\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093f |\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947\u093d\u092a\u093f \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u092e\u0943\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0924\u093f || 72||.\ne\u1e63h\u0101 br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti\u1e25 p\u0101rtha nain\u0101\u1e41 pr\u0101pya vimuhyatisthitv\u0101sy\u0101m anta-k\u0101le \u2019pi brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47am \u1e5bichchhati.\nesha brahmi sthitih partha nainam prapya vimuhyatisthitvasyam anta-kale \u2019pi brahma-nirvanam richchhati.", "english": " O Parth, such is the state of an enlightened soul that having attained it, one is never again deluded.

They have gained a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, which helps them make wise decisions and live a more fulfilling life.\n\nMoreover, this state of consciousness can also help individuals face death with peace and acceptance. Instead of fearing the unknown, they are confident that their soul will continue to exist in its purest form after the body dies.

We might be daydreaming, scrolling through social media, or worrying about future events.

The brothers were walking from their house to hear the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam discourse at the temple. On the way, it began raining heavily, so they ran into the nearest building for shelter. To their dismay, they found themselves in a brothel, where women of disrepute were dancing to entertain their guests. Tavrit, the elder brother, was appalled and walked out into the rain, to continue to the temple. The younger brother, Suvrit, felt no harm in sitting there for a while to escape getting wet in the rain..\nTavrit reached the temple and sat for the discourse, but in his mind he became remorseful, \u201cO how boring this is! I made a dreadful mistake; I should have remained at the brothel. My brother must be enjoying himself greatly in revelry there.\u201d Suvrit, on the other hand, started thinking, \u201cWhy did I remain in this house of sin? My brother is so holy; he is bathing his intellect in the knowledge of the Bh\u0101gavatam. I too should have braved the rain and reached there. After all, I am not made of salt that I would have melted in a little bit of rain.\u201d.\nWhen the rain stopped, both started out in the direction of the other. The moment they met, lightning struck them and they both died on the spot. The Yamdoots (servants of the god of Death) came to take Tavrit to hell. Tavrit complained, \u201cI think you have made a mistake. I am Tavrit. It was my brother who was sitting at the brothel a little while ago. You should be taking him to hell.\u201d The Yamdoots replied, \u201cWe have made no mistake. He was sitting there to avoid the rain, but in his mind he was longing to be at the Bh\u0101gavatam discourse. On the other hand, while you were sitting and hearing the discourse, your mind was yearning to be at the brothel.\u201d Tavrit was doing exactly what Shree Krishna declares in this verse; he had externally renounced the objects of the senses, but was dwelling upon them in the mind. This was the improper kind of renunciation. The next verse states the proper kind of renunciation..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, where success and material gains are highly valued, it is easy to get caught up in the lure of wealth and power. However, this verse from Bhagavad Gita serves as a reminder that true renunciation goes beyond just giving up external possessions or actions. It also requires mental and intellectual detachment from sensual desires and base motives.\n\nIn the modern context, we often see people abandoning their careers or responsibilities in pursuit of an ascetic lifestyle, only to realize later that they have not truly renounced their attachment to material pleasures. This creates a state of hypocrisy where one displays an external show of spirituality while living a life filled with ignoble sentiments and base motives.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of facing the challenges of the world as a karm yogi, rather than running away from them by prematurely taking sannyasa (renunciation). Saint Kabir's sarcastic statement, \"O Ascetic Yogi, you have donned the ochre robes, but you have ignored dyeing your mind with the color of renunciation,\" further emphasizes this point.\n\nThe story of Tavrit and Suvrit is a classic example of this concept. Both brothers were on their way to hear Bhagavatam discourse at the temple when it started raining heavily.

However, both brothers' minds were filled with desires and longings for what they had left behind. This internal attachment led to their downfall, as they died on the spot when lightning struck them.\n\nIn today's corporate world, where success is often measured by external factors such as wealth and power, it can be challenging to maintain mental and intellectual detachment from sensual desires.

This leads to hypocrisy and delusion, as one's actions do not match their inner intentions.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, this can be seen in many startups and entrepreneurs who give up their stable jobs and careers to pursue a new venture. However, they may still hold onto their old desires and habits, leading to internal conflicts and struggles. This can result in failure or burnout, as they are not fully committed to their new path.\n\nThe story of Tavrit and Suvrit also illustrates this point. Both brothers were on their way to hear the Bhagavatam discourse, but when it started raining heavily, Suvrit chose to take shelter in a brothel while Tavrit continued on his way. However, both brothers' minds were consumed by thoughts of the other's actions, leading to regret and remorse. This shows that true renunciation requires not only external actions but also mental and intellectual withdrawal from sensual desires.\n\nIn the startup world, this can be achieved through mindfulness, self-reflection, and a deep understanding of one's own motivations and desires. By cultivating inner peace and clarity, entrepreneurs can make more informed decisions and avoid falling into the trap of hypocrisy and delusion.

This is especially important in today's world, where materialism and technology can easily distract us from our inner selves. By cultivating mindfulness and self-reflection, we can achieve true renunciation and avoid falling into the trap of hypocrisy and delusion.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse can be interpreted as a warning against superficial spiritual practices that lack genuine inner transformation.

This kind of hypocrisy is not true renunciation and ultimately leads to self-delusion. Instead, it's essential to cultivate inner detachment through meditation, introspection, and selfless service while continuing to engage in one's daily duties as a karm yogi. Running away from life's challenges by prematurely taking sannyas (renunciation) is not the answer; true spiritual progress requires facing life's struggles with wisdom and equanimity. The story of Tavrit and Suvrit illustrates this point, where one brother externally renounced worldly pleasures but was still mentally attached to them, while the other brother remained steadfast in his spiritual practice despite temporary external difficulties. Ultimately, true renunciation requires a deep inner transformation that goes beyond mere outward appearances.", "student": "In today's world, this verse can be interpreted as a warning against superficial spirituality and hypocrisy. It highlights the danger of appearing to renounce the material world while still being attached to it mentally. This kind of behavior is considered delusional and hypocritical by Shree Krishna in Bhagavad Gita.\n\nIn our modern society, where social media and materialism are prevalent, many people may outwardly appear to be spiritual or religious, but their inner thoughts and desires may contradict this image. They may follow certain rituals or practices, but if they continue to dwell on sensual objects in their minds, it is a sign of hypocrisy.\n\nFor example, someone may give up their job and possessions to become an ascetic, but if they still crave material comforts or are motivated by selfish desires, it is not true renunciation.

It consists of two main concepts: karm (occupational duties) and Yog (union with God). Hence, a karm yogi is one who performs worldly duties while keeping the mind attached to God. Such a karm yogi is not bound by karma even while performing all kinds of works. This is because what binds one to the law of karma is not actions, but the attachment to the fruits of those actions.

However, the concept of karm yog, as explained in Bhagvad Gita, can provide a solution.\n\nKarm yog is the practice of performing one's duties with selfless action and detachment from the outcome. It involves controlling the senses and mind while engaging in work without attachment to the results. In modern terms, this can be understood as working with a sense of purpose and responsibility rather than being driven by personal gain or recognition.\n\nIn the corporate world, karm yog can lead to superior performance because it helps individuals to focus on their tasks at hand instead of getting distracted by external factors. It also fosters a sense of teamwork and collaboration as people work together towards a common goal rather than competing for individual success.\n\nMoreover, practicing karm yog in the workplace can have positive impacts on an individual's mental and emotional well-being. By detaching from the outcome, one can avoid stress and anxiety associated with high-pressure jobs. It also helps to cultivate a sense of contentment and satisfaction with one's work, regardless of the results.\n\nIn contrast, false renunciation, as mentioned in Bhagvad Gita, refers to individuals who appear to have given up worldly pursuits but still harbor attachment to material possessions or outcomes. In the corporate context, this can manifest as people who avoid taking on responsibilities or making decisions due to fear of failure or loss. Such behavior not only hinders their own growth but also affects the overall performance and productivity of the organization.\n\nIn conclusion, karm yog is a valuable concept that can be applied in the modern corporate world to promote success, teamwork, and personal growth while maintaining spiritual values.

They should avoid being overly invested in the outcome, as this can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout. Instead, they should trust in their abilities, their team's capabilities, and the universe's plan.\n\nThe verse 3.7 from Bhagvad Gita emphasizes that those who control their senses and engage them in work without attachment are superior. This can be interpreted as a call to prioritize focus, discipline, and self-control over external distractions or desires. In the startup world, this means avoiding getting sidetracked by competition, criticism, or failure. Instead, founders should remain focused on their goals, values, and vision, and trust in their own abilities to overcome challenges and obstacles.\n\nIn summary, karm yogi is a concept that can help entrepreneurs and startup founders navigate the complexities of the modern world with a sense of inner peace, clarity, and purpose.

It is not about renouncing work or material possessions but rather about detaching oneself from the attachment and cravings for their fruits. A karm yogi recognizes that true happiness and fulfillment come from serving God through selfless action, rather than seeking personal gain.\n\nIn today's world, this concept of karm yog can be applied in various aspects of our lives.

As Shakespeare said: \u201cFor there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d Similarly, work in itself is neither good nor bad. Depending upon the state of the mind, it can be either binding or elevating. Work done for the enjoyment of one\u2019s senses and the gratification of one\u2019s pride is the cause of bondage in the material world, while work performed as yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice) for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord liberates one from the bonds of Maya and attracts divine grace.

So he decided to use his wealth to please God by serving his citizens with it.\u201d After the yaj\u00f1a, Raghu donated all his possessions to his citizens. Then, donning the rags of a beggar and holding an earthen pot, he went out to beg for his meal..\nWhile resting under a tree, he heard a group of people discussing, \u201cOur king is so benevolent. He has given away everything in charity.\u201d Raghu was pained on hearing his praise and spoke out, \u201cWhat are you discussing?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe are praising our king. There is nobody in the world as charitable as him.\u201d Raghu retorted, \u201cDo not ever say that again. Raghu has given nothing.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat kind of person are you who are criticizing our king?

This principle, known as karm yog, can have significant benefits in the context of modern life, particularly in the startup world where success and failure are closely linked with one's actions.\n\nIn a startup, work is often intense, demanding, and all-consuming. It can be easy to get caught up in the pursuit of success and forget the true purpose of our efforts. However, if we approach our work as a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, it can have transformative effects on us. Firstly, it helps us to detach ourselves from the outcome of our actions. Instead of being attached to the results, we focus on performing our duties with integrity and dedication, trusting that the outcome will be in line with the divine plan. This detachment frees us from the stress and anxiety associated with outcomes and allows us to work with a clear mind and heart.\n\nSecondly, when we perform work as a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, it helps us to cultivate a sense of gratitude and service towards others. We see the world and everything in it as belonging to God, meant for utilization in his service. This perspective shifts our focus from personal gain to the greater good, and we become more aware of how our actions impact those around us. In a startup context, this can lead to better decision-making, as we consider the long-term consequences of our actions on our employees, customers, and stakeholders.\n\nThirdly, when we perform work as a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, it helps us to develop a deeper sense of selflessness and humility. We recognize that everything we have is a gift from God, and we use it for his pleasure rather than for our own gratification. This attitude of service and gratitude can foster a culture of collaboration and teamwork in a startup, as everyone works towards a common goal with a spirit of generosity and compassion.\n\nIn conclusion, the principle of karm yog is not just a spiritual concept but also a practical one that can have significant benefits in the context of modern life, particularly in the startup world. By approaching our work as a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, we can detach ourselves from outcomes, cultivate gratitude and service towards others, and develop a deeper sense of selflessness and humility. These qualities are essential for success in a startup, where collaboration, teamwork, and a long-term perspective are crucial.

Therefore, O son of Kunti, for the satisfaction of God, perform your prescribed duties, without being attached to the results,\" reminds us that our actions should not be motivated by personal gain or pleasure but rather done with a pure intention to please God.\n\nJust like a knife can be used for both good and evil purposes depending on who wields it, work in itself is neither good nor bad. It is our attitude towards it that determines whether it binds us or liberates us from the material world. When we perform actions with an egoistic mindset, seeking recognition or reward, we become attached to the results and fall into the cycle of birth and death. However, when we approach work as a sacrifice to God, we detach ourselves from the outcome and offer it up as a service to Him.\n\nKing Raghu's example in performing the Vi\u015bhwajit yaj\u00f1a is a beautiful illustration of this principle. He saw himself as a mere instrument of God, gathering resources for His pleasure rather than his own. By donating all his possessions to his citizens and living as a beggar, he demonstrated true detachment from material wealth and attachment to God's will.\n\nIn today's world, where the pursuit of success and material gain is often prioritized over spiritual values, it can be challenging to maintain this perspective. However, by remembering that everything we have comes from God and should ultimately be offered back to Him, we can cultivate a sense of detachment and service in our actions.

It is in the performance of its yaj\u00f1a toward the body that the self-interest of the hand is also fulfilled.

After the offering, the food in the plate is considered pras\u0101d (grace of God). All the food in the plate and the pots is then accepted as God\u2019s grace and eaten in that consciousness.

On the other hand, when we cook and consume food solely for our own pleasure and enjoyment without any spiritual significance or offering, it becomes a source of sin. This is because even vegetarian food contains life in the form of microorganisms and plants, and consuming it with selfish intentions leads to the destruction of that life. Therefore, by eating pras\u0101d, we not only nourish our bodies but also cultivate a sense of spirituality and selflessness. In contrast, consuming food without any spiritual significance perpetuates our egoistic tendencies and causes us to accumulate negative karma. This verse highlights the importance of offering food as a sacrifice to a higher power and consuming it with a spirit of gratitude and devotion.

They prioritize their own sensual pleasures over fulfilling their duties and responsibilities towards society, which ultimately leads to a meaningless existence.\n\nIn modern times, this concept can be applied in various aspects of life such as work, relationships, and personal growth. For instance, individuals who neglect their professional obligations or fail to contribute positively to their communities are considered irresponsible and sinful by society's standards. Similarly, those who prioritize their own desires over the well-being of their loved ones in relationships also fall into this category.\n\nThe cycle of cause and effect, as described in the verse, can be seen as a chain reaction where every individual plays a role in maintaining its smooth functioning. When most people accept their responsibility to contribute positively towards society, it leads to material prosperity and spiritual growth. On the other hand, when a significant portion of society rejects its responsibility towards the universal system, it creates discord and chaos, leading to social and cultural regression.\n\nIn summary, this verse highlights the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions within the framework of societal norms and values, which ultimately leads to personal growth, harmony in society, and spiritual elevation."}}, "3.17": {"sanskrit": " \u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0930\u0947\u0935 \u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0924\u0943\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0935: |\u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0935 \u091a \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 || 17||.\nyas tv\u0101tma-ratir eva sy\u0101d \u0101tma-t\u1e5bipta\u015bh cha m\u0101nava\u1e25\u0101tmanyeva cha santu\u1e63h\u1e6das tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 na vidyate.\nyas tvatma-ratir eva syad atma-triptash cha manavahatmanyeva cha santushtas tasya karyam na vidyate.", "english": " But those who rejoice in the self, who are illumined and fully satisfied in the self, for them, there is no duty.\n                        .\nOnly those who have given up desires for external objects can rejoice and be satisfied in the self. The root of bondage is our material desires, \u201cThis should happen; that should not happen.\u201d Shree Krishna explains a little further ahead in this chapter (in verse 3.37) that desire is the cause of all sins, consequently, it must be renounced. As explained previously (in the purport of verse 2.64), it must be borne in mind that whenever Shree Krishna says we should give up desire, he refers to material desires, and not to the aspirations for spiritual progress or the desire to realize God..\nHowever, why do material desires arise in the first place? When we identify the self with the body, we identify with the yearnings of the body and mind as the desires of the self, and these send us spinning into the realm of Maya. Sage Tulsidas explains:.\njiba jiba te hari te bilag\u0101no taba te deha geha nija m\u0101nyo,.\nm\u0101y\u0101 basa swar\u016bp bisar\u0101yo tehi brama te d\u0101ru\u1e47a du\u1e25kh p\u0101yo. [ v13].\n\u201cWhen the soul separated itself from God, the material energy covered it in an illusion. By virtue of that illusion, it began thinking of itself as the body, and ever since, in forgetfulness of the self, it has been experiencing immense misery.\u201d.\nThose who are illumined realize that the self is not material in nature, but divine, and hence imperishable. The perishable objects of the world can never fulfill the thirst of the imperishable soul, and therefore it is a folly to hanker after those sense-objects. Thus, self-illumined souls learn to unite their consciousness with God and experience his infinite bliss within them..\nThe karm (duties) prescribed for the materially conditioned souls are no longer applicable to such illumined souls because they have already attained the goal of all such karm. For example, as long as one is a college student, one is obliged to follow the rules of the university, but for one who has graduated and earned the degree, the rules now become irrelevant. For such liberated souls, it is said: brahmavit \u015bhruti m\u016brdhn\u012b[v14] \u201cThose who have united themselves with God now walk on the head of the Vedas,\u201d i.e. they have no need to follow the rules of the Vedas any longer..\nThe goal of the Vedas is to help unite the soul with God. Once the soul becomes God-realized, the rules of the Vedas, which helped the soul to reach that destination, now no longer apply; the soul has transcended their area of jurisdiction. For example, a pundit unites a man and woman in wedlock by performing the marriage ceremony. Once the ceremony is over, he says, \u201cYou are now husband and wife; I am leaving.\u201d His task is over. If the wife says, \u201cPunditji, the vows you made us take during the marriage ceremony are not being followed by my husband, the pundit will reply, \u201cThat is not my area of expertise. My duty was to get you both united in marriage and that work is over.\u201d Similarly the Vedas are there to help unite the self with the Supreme Self. When God-realization takes place, the task of the Vedas is over. Such an enlightened soul is no longer obliged to perform the Vedic duties..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita can be interpreted as follows: Those who find true happiness and contentment within themselves, without relying on external material possessions or desires, are considered self-realized individuals.

This does not mean that one should abandon all responsibilities and duties in life, but rather that true fulfillment comes from within and is not dependent on external factors. The material desires that bind us to the world of maya can only be overcome by recognizing our true nature as divine and imperishable souls. As Tulsidas explains, when we identify ourselves with the body and mind, we become subject to suffering and misery. Only by uniting our consciousness with God can we experience true bliss and freedom from material desires. The rules and duties prescribed for those who are still on the path of spiritual evolution may no longer apply to self-realized individuals, as they have already attained their ultimate goal.

It encourages us to find true happiness and fulfillment within ourselves rather than seeking it externally through desires and material possessions. The verse suggests that those who have attained self-realization, who are enlightened and content with their inner selves, do not have any duties or obligations as they have already achieved their ultimate goal.\n\nIn the context of modern life, this can be interpreted in various ways. Firstly, it highlights the importance of inner peace and contentment over external achievements and successes. In our pursuit of wealth, power, and status, we often forget to nourish our inner selves, leading to stress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. By focusing on self-realization and finding happiness within ourselves, we can lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life.\n\nSecondly, it emphasizes the need to let go of material desires and attachments. In today's consumerist society, we are bombarded with advertisements and marketing messages that create a constant craving for new products and experiences. This can lead to a never-ending cycle of consumption and dissatisfaction as we always want more. By learning to detach ourselves from these material desires and finding contentment in what we already have, we can break free from this cycle and experience true happiness.\n\nThirdly, it encourages us to prioritize our spiritual growth over worldly duties and obligations. In today's busy and demanding work culture, we often neglect our spiritual needs in favor of meeting deadlines and fulfilling responsibilities. By making time for meditation, prayer, or any other spiritual practice, we can cultivate inner peace, clarity, and wisdom that will help us navigate through life's challenges with ease and grace.\n\nIn summary, this verse from Bhagavad Gita reminds us to focus on our inner selves, let go of material desires, and prioritize our spiritual growth in order to lead a truly fulfilling and contented life.

Self-realization involves recognizing that our true nature is divine and eternal, rather than identifying with the temporary and perishable body. As a result, self-realized individuals learn to connect with the infinite bliss within themselves and no longer feel the need to follow societal rules or expectations that do not align with their spiritual path.

Previously, Shree Krishna was talking about karm, (or prescribed worldly duties) and saying that they must be done as an offering to God. This was necessary to purify the mind, helping it rise above worldly contamination. But self-realized souls have already reached absorption in God and developed purity of mind. These transcendentalists are directly engaged in bhakti, or pure spiritual activities, such as meditation, worship, k\u012brtan, service to the Guru, etc. If such souls reject their worldly duties, it is not considered a sin. They may continue to perform worldly duties if they wish, but they are not obliged to do them..\nHistorically, Saints have been of two kinds. 1) Those like Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, and Vibheeshan, who continued to discharge their worldly duties even after attaining the transcendental platform. These were the karm yogis\u2014externally they were doing their duties with their body while internally their minds were attached to God. 2) Those like Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who rejected their worldly duties and accepted the renounced order of life. These were the karm sany\u0101s\u012bs, who were both internally and externally, with both body and mind, engaged only in devotion to God.

Some self-realized individuals may choose to renounce their worldly duties and pursue a life of service and devotion to God.

Even after reaching the transcendental platform, he continued to do his worldly duties, purely for the reason that it would set a good example for the world to follow. Many other Saints did the same..\nHumanity is inspired by the ideals that they see in the lives of great people. Such leaders inspire society by their example and become shining beacons for the masses to follow. Leaders of society thus have a moral responsibility to set lofty examples for inspiring the rest of the population by their words, deeds, and character. When noble leaders are in the forefront, the rest of society naturally gets uplifted in morality, selflessness, and spiritual strength. But in times when there is a vacuum of principled leadership, the rest of society has no standards to pursue and slumps into self-centeredness, moral bankruptcy, and spiritual lassitude. Hence, great personalities should always act in an exemplary manner to set the standard for the world. Even though they themselves may have risen to the transcendental platform, and may not need to perform prescribed Vedic duties, by doing so, they inspire others to perform prescribed Vedic actions..\nIf a great leader of society becomes a karm sany\u0101s\u012b, and renounces work, it sets an errant precedent for others. The leader may be at the transcendental platform and therefore eligible to renounce work and engage completely in spirituality. However, others in society use their example as an excuse for escapism, to run away from their responsibilities. Such escapists cite the instances of the great karm sany\u0101s\u012bs, such as Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Following their lofty footsteps, these imposters also renounce worldly duties and take sany\u0101s, even though they have not yet attained the purity of mind required for it. In India, we find thousands of such sadhus. They copy the examples of the great sany\u0101s\u012bs and don the ochre robes, without the concurrent internal enlightenment and bliss. Though externally renounced, their nature forces them to seek happiness, and devoid of the divine bliss of God, they begin indulging in the lowly pleasure of intoxication. Thus, they slip even below the level of people in household life, as stated in the following verse:.\nbrahma j\u00f1\u0101na j\u0101nyo nah\u012b\u1e45, karm diye chhi\u1e6dak\u0101ya,tulas\u012b ais\u012b \u0101tm\u0101 sahaja naraka mah\u00f1 j\u0101ya. [v15].\nSage Tulsidas says: \u201cOne who renounces worldly duties, without the concurrent internal enlightenment with divine knowledge, treads the quick path to hell.\u201d.\nInstead, if a great leader is a karm yogi, at least the followers will continue to do their karm and dutifully perform their responsibilities. This will help them learn to discipline their mind and senses, and slowly rise to the transcendental platform. Hence, to present an example for society to follow, Shree Krishna suggests that Arjun should practice karm yog. He now gives his own example to illustrate the above point..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita has important implications for leaders and individuals in society.

If we, as individuals, stop performing our prescribed actions or abandon our roles in society, it can have a ripple effect on those around us. Others may follow our example and also renounce their duties, leading to a breakdown of social order and the erosion of values.\n\nFor instance, if a doctor stops practicing medicine, other doctors might be influenced by this decision and also abandon their profession. This could result in a shortage of healthcare professionals and a decline in the quality of medical care available to people. Similarly, if a teacher stops teaching, it can lead to a lack of education for students, which can have long-lasting negative effects on their future prospects.\n\nTherefore, it's essential that we understand our roles and responsibilities in society and fulfill them diligently. This not only benefits ourselves but also contributes to the overall welfare of society as a whole. By performing our prescribed actions, we can help maintain social order, promote values, and prevent chaos and destruction.\n\nIn summary, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita teaches us that fulfilling our duties is crucial for maintaining social harmony and preventing pandemonium in society.

Dharma comes from the root word dh\u1e5bi, which means \u1e0dh\u0101ra\u1e47 karane yogya, or \u201cresponsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.\u201d For example, the dharma of the soul is to love God. It is like the central law of our being..\nThe prefix swa means \u201cthe self.\u201d Thus, swa-dharma is our personal dharma, which is the dharma applicable to our context, situation, maturity, and profession in life. This swa-dharma can change as our context in life changes, and as we grow spiritually. By asking Arjun to follow his swa-dharma, Shree Krishna is telling him to follow his profession, and not change it because someone else may be doing something else..\nIt is more enjoyable to be ourselves than to pretend to be someone else. The duties born of our nature can be easily performed with stability of mind. The duties of others may seem attractive from a distance and we may think of switching, but that is a risky thing to do. If they conflict with our nature, they will create disharmony in our senses, mind, and intellect. This will be detrimental for our consciousness and will hinder our progress on the spiritual path. Shree Krishna emphasizes this point dramatically by saying that it is better to die in the faithful performance of one\u2019s duty than to be in the unnatural position of doing another\u2019s duty..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, the concept of swa-dharma or one's personal duty and responsibility can be applied in several ways. It encourages individuals to identify their unique strengths, skills, and passions and align them with their professional pursuits. This not only leads to greater job satisfaction but also contributes to overall organizational success.\n\nThe verse from Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the importance of following one's own duty, even if it has some flaws or imperfections, rather than attempting to fulfill someone else's responsibilities perfectly. This is because our natural inclinations and abilities are deeply ingrained in us, and trying to force ourselves into a role that doesn't fit our nature can lead to stress, burnout, and decreased productivity.\n\nMoreover, the verse highlights the significance of staying true to one's swa-dharma even in the face of challenges or obstacles. It is better to persevere through difficulties while fulfilling our duties than to abandon them for a seemingly easier path. This principle can help individuals stay committed to their goals and values, which ultimately leads to personal growth and professional success.\n\nIn summary, following one's swa-dharma in the corporate world involves identifying one's unique strengths and passions, aligning them with professional pursuits, staying true to one's duties even in challenging circumstances, and recognizing that it is better to perform imperfectly than to attempt someone else's responsibilities perfectly.", "startup": "In today's fast-paced and competitive world, where everyone seems to be striving for success, it can be tempting to follow someone else's path or take on their responsibilities. However, according to the teachings of Bhagvad Gita, it is much better to stick to our own natural duties and roles, even if they are not perfect, than to try and fulfill someone else's responsibilities perfectly. This is because our own duties are tailored to our unique circumstances, maturity levels, and professions in life, and following them brings stability and enjoyment to our minds.\n\nIn the modern context, this verse can be applied to startups and entrepreneurship. It's easy to get caught up in the success stories of other entrepreneurs and try to replicate their strategies or products. However, this may not work for everyone, as every startup has its own unique circumstances and challenges. Instead, it's better to focus on our own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) and develop a strategy that aligns with our own nature and values.\n\nFurthermore, the verse emphasizes the importance of sticking to our own duties even in the face of danger or failure. It's easy to get discouraged and switch paths when things don't go as planned, but this can lead to further complications and disharmony in our senses, minds, and intellects. Instead, we should have faith in our own abilities and persevere through the challenges, knowing that it is better to die while fulfilling our duties than to follow someone else's path, which may not be aligned with our nature or values.\n\nIn conclusion, following our own natural duties and roles, even if they are not perfect, is more enjoyable and brings stability to our minds in the modern world. It's better to stick to our own strengths and values, rather than trying to replicate someone else's success story. And when faced with challenges or failure, we should have faith in ourselves and persevere through them, knowing that it is better to die while fulfilling our duties than to follow someone else's path.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita can be interpreted as follows: It is better to fulfill your unique responsibilities and duties, even if they have some flaws or imperfections, than to take on someone else's duties perfectly. In fact, it is more preferable to honor your own duties until the end, rather than trying to follow someone else's path that may be dangerous or risky for you.\n\nIn modern times, this concept of swa-dharma (one's personal duty) can be applied in various aspects of our lives. For instance, it could mean staying true to your values and principles, even if they are not popular or accepted by others. It could also mean pursuing a career that aligns with your skills and interests, rather than choosing a job just for the sake of money or prestige.\n\nMoreover, this verse emphasizes the importance of being authentic and true to oneself. When we try to be someone else or follow a path that is not meant for us, it can create confusion, stress, and disharmony in our lives. This can hinder our personal growth and spiritual progress. Therefore, it's crucial to honor our unique responsibilities and duties, even if they are not perfect, rather than trying to be someone else or follow a path that is not meant for us.\n\nIn summary, the verse encourages us to stay true to our own nature, values, and principles, and fulfill our unique responsibilities until the end, rather than trying to be someone else or follow a path that is not meant for us.

The conscience is grounded in the fact that God is the abode of virtue, and as his fragments, we all have an innate attraction for virtue and goodness. The goodness that is the nature of the soul gives rise to the voice of conscience. Thus, we cannot make the excuse that we did not know stealing, swindling, libel, extortion, murder, oppression, and corruption are sinful activities.

They may rationalize these actions as necessary for survival or growth, but deep down they know it goes against their values and principles. This can create a sense of inner conflict that ultimately hinders their progress and happiness.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita teaches us to strive for a life free from attachment and aversion, which allows us to make decisions based on our conscience rather than external influences or pressures.

It requires a strong sense of self-awareness, discipline, and integrity to resist the pull of shortcuts and stay true to one's values.\n\nIn summary, Arjun's question in this verse speaks to the universal struggle of balancing our desires and principles with external pressures and expectations.

It suggests that there is a deeper force at play, beyond our conscious control. This force could be attributed to our subconscious mind, which is shaped by our past experiences and conditioning. Our habits, fears, and desires are deeply ingrained within us, and they can exert a powerful influence on our actions.\n\nIn modern terms, we might say that this force is similar to the concept of addiction or habit formation.

Thus, lust shows itself in many ways\u2014the urge for money, physical cravings, craving for prestige, the drive for power, etc. This lust is only a perverted reflection of love for God, which is the inherent nature of every living being. When the soul associates with the material energy in the form of the body, its divine love for God is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Since divine love is the highest power of God, its perversion in the material realm, which is lust, is also the most powerful force in worldly activities..\nShree Krishna identifies this \u201clust\u201d for worldly enjoyment as the cause of sin, as the malignant allure sitting within us. The mode of passion deludes the soul into believing that worldly objects will give satisfaction, and so one creates desires for acquiring them. When desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed; when it is not satisfied, it gives rise to anger. One commits sins under the influence of all three\u2014lust, greed, and anger.

Shree Krishna's message here is that we should be aware of this \"lust\" within us and not let it control our actions. Instead, we should strive to channelize our desires towards more spiritual pursuits and avoid getting entangled in the allure of materialism.

This discrimination resides in the intellect. However, lust is such a formidable adversary that it clouds the discriminatory ability of the intellect. Shree Krishna gives three grades of examples to illustrate this principle. Fire, which is the source of light, gets covered by smoke. This partial obscuring is like the thin cloud that s\u0101ttvic desires create. A mirror, which is naturally reflective, gets obscured by dust. This semi-opacity is like the masking impact of r\u0101jasic desires on the intellect. And an embryo gets concealed in the womb.

Similarly, in proportion to the grade of our desires, the spiritual knowledge we may have heard and read gets shrouded..\nThere is a beautiful allegorical story to illustrate this point. A man used to take his evening walk by the side of a forest. One evening, he decided to walk in the forest instead. When he had walked a couple of miles, the sun began setting and the light started fading. He turned around to walk out of the forest, but to his dismay he found that animals had gathered on the other side. These ferocious animals started chasing him and to escape from them, he ran deeper into the forest. While running, he found a witch standing in front of him with open arms to embrace him. To escape her, he turned direction and ran perpendicular to the animals and the witch. By then, it had become dark. Unable to see much, he ran over a ditch that was covered by vine hanging from a tree. He fell headlong, but his feet became entangled in the vine. As a result, he began hanging upside down above the ditch. After a few moments he came to his senses and saw a snake sitting at the bottom of the ditch, waiting to bite him if he fell down. In the meantime, two mice appeared\u2014one white and one black\u2014and started nibbling at the branch from which the vine was hanging. To confound his problems, some wasps gathered and began stinging him on his face. In this precarious situation, it was found that the man was smiling. Philosophers gathered to ponder how he could smile in such a dire strait. They looked upwards and found a beehive, from which honey was dripping onto his tongue. He was licking the honey and thinking how pleasurable it was; he had forgotten the animals, the witch, the snake, the mice, and the wasps..\nThe person in the story may seem insane to us. However, this tale depicts the condition of all humans under the influence of desire. The forest in which the man was walking represents the material world in which we live, where there is danger at every step. The animals that chased him represent diseases that begin to appear in life, and continue harassing us until death. The witch represented old age that is waiting to embrace us with the passage of time. The snake at the bottom of the pit is like the inevitable death that awaits us all. The white and black mice that were nibbling on the branch represent day and night, which are steadily reducing our life and bringing us closer to death. The wasps that were stinging the face are like the innumerable desires that arise in the mind and agitate it, causing us pain and distress. Honey represents the sensual enjoyment we experience in the world, which clouds the discrimination of our intellect.

Having identified the repositories of lust, Shree Krishna asks Arjun, at the outset, to curb the desires of the senses. Permitting them to arise is the cause of our miseries, while eliminating them is the way to peace..\nConsider the following example. Ramesh and Dinesh were two fellow students sharing the same room in the hostel. At 10 pm at night, Ramesh developed the desire to smoke cigarettes. He said, \u201cI am getting the urge to smoke.\u201d Dinesh replied, \u201cIt is so late at night. Forget about cigarettes and go to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026no\u2026I will not be able to sleep until I puff the tobacco,\u201d said Ramesh. Dinesh went to sleep, but Ramesh went out in search of cigarettes. The shops nearby had closed. It took him two hours until he finally returned to the hostel with the cigarette and had a smoke..\nIn the morning, Dinesh asked him, \u201cRamesh, when did you sleep at night?\u201d \u201cAt midnight.\u201d \u201cReally! That means you remained agitated for cigarettes for two hours and when you had your puffs, you returned to the same state that you were in at 10 pm.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked Ramesh. \u201cLook, at 10 pm you did not have any desire for cigarettes, and you were peaceful. Then you yourself created the desire for them. From 10 pm to midnight, you remained agitated for cigarettes. Finally, when you smoked them, the disease, which you had created, went away, and you got to sleep. I, on the other hand, did not create any desire, and slept peacefully at 10 pm itself.\u201d.\nIn this way, we create desires for the objects of the senses of the body, and then become agitated by them. When we get the cherished object, the disease of our own creation gets eradicated, and we think of it as happiness.\u201d However, if we think of ourselves as the soul and our only purpose is happiness of the soul, then it becomes easier to renounce such material desires.

To accomplish this we must use the higher instruments given by God to us, as stated in the next verse..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, where constant stimulation and distractions are a norm, it is crucial to understand and apply the teachings of Bhagvad Gita in our daily lives.

Shree Krishna's teachings in Bhagvad Gita provide us with a framework for understanding the hierarchy of our inner faculties, which can help us gain control over our desires and find true fulfillment.\n\nStarting from the grossest level, our body is made up of physical matter. But beyond this material shell lies our five senses - taste, touch, sight, smell, and sound - that allow us to perceive the world around us. These senses are superior to the body because they have the power to influence our thoughts and actions.\n\nHowever, even these senses are subordinate to the mind, which is the seat of our thoughts, emotions, and memories. The mind has the ability to interpret sensory input and create mental images or concepts. It's like a movie screen that displays the images projected by our senses.\n\nBut beyond the mind lies the intellect, which is responsible for discriminating between what is right and wrong, true and false. It helps us make rational decisions based on logic and reasoning. The intellect is superior to the mind because it can override its impulses and desires.\n\nHowever, even the intellect is subordinate to the soul, which is the essence of our being. The soul is eternal, unchanging, and indestructible. It's like a pure consciousness that pervades every aspect of our existence. The soul is superior to the intellect because it's not bound by the limitations of time, space, or matter.\n\nUnderstanding this hierarchy of inner faculties can help us gain control over our desires and find true fulfillment. By recognizing the superiority of the intellect and soul over the senses and mind, we can learn to detach ourselves from the material world and focus on what truly matters. This knowledge is especially relevant in today's startup world, where success often comes at the cost of sacrificing our inner values and spiritual well-being. By prioritizing our intellect and soul, we can create sustainable and fulfilling businesses that align with our higher purpose.", "personal": "In today's world, we can apply this concept to understand how we can gain control over our thoughts and actions. Just like the body is controlled by the senses, our senses can be influenced by external stimuli that lead us towards negative or destructive behaviors. However, we have the power to control these senses through our mind, which has the ability to focus and direct our thoughts.\n\nThe intellect, with its ability to discern between right and wrong, can further guide us in making wise decisions. But ultimately, it is the soul that holds the highest level of consciousness and true identity. By recognizing this divine essence within ourselves, we can cultivate a deeper sense of self-awareness and moral values, which will help us overcome negative impulses and lead a more fulfilling life.\n\nIn practical terms, this knowledge can be used to develop habits that promote positive thinking and behavior. For example, if we notice that our senses are being drawn towards unhealthy or addictive activities, we can use our mind to redirect our thoughts towards more productive and wholesome pursuits. By consistently practicing this discipline, we can strengthen our intellect and cultivate a deeper connection with our soul, leading us towards a more fulfilling and virtuous life.\n\nIn summary, the verse teaches us that by understanding the hierarchy of consciousness within ourselves, we can gain greater control over our thoughts and actions, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and moral existence.", "student": "In today's world, we can apply this concept to understand how we can gain control over our thoughts and actions.

It helps us to distinguish between what is beneficial for us and what is not. And finally, there is the soul, which is our true self or essence. This divine part of us is untouched by the material world and remains pure and unchanging.\n\nBy understanding this hierarchy of superiority amongst these entities, we can learn to detach ourselves from the distractions of the senses and focus on our intellect and soul.

Since the soul is a part of God, it is divine in nature. Thus, the divine bliss it seeks can only be attained from a divine subject, while the objects of the world are all material. These material objects can never fulfill the innate longing of the soul and so it is futile to create desires for them. We must exert and train the intellect to think in this manner, and then use it to control the mind and the senses..\nThis is explained very beautifully in the Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had with the help of the model of a chariot:.\n\u0101tm\u0101nagva\u1e41 rathina\u1e41 viddhi \u015bhar\u012bra\u1e41 rathameva tubuddhi\u1e41 tu s\u0101rathi\u1e41 viddhi mana\u1e25 pragrahameva chaindriy\u0101\u1e47i hay\u0101n\u0101hurvi\u1e63hay\u0101nste\u1e63hu gochar\u0101n\u0101tmendriyamanoyukta\u1e41 bhoktety\u0101hurman\u012b\u1e63hi\u1e47a\u1e25 (1.3.3-4) [v21].\nThe Upani\u1e63hads say there is a chariot, which has five horses pulling it; the horses have reins in their mouths, which are in the hands of a charioteer; a passenger is sitting at the back of the chariot. Ideally, the passenger should instruct the charioteer, who should then control the reins and guide the horses in the proper direction. However, in this case, the passenger has gone to sleep, and so the horses are holding sway..\nIn this analogy, the chariot is the body, the horses are the five senses, the reins in the mouth of the horses is the mind, the charioteer is the intellect, and the passenger seated behind is the soul residing in the body. The senses (horses) desire pleasurable things. The mind (reins) is not exercising restraint on the senses (horses). The intellect (charioteer) submits to the pull of the reins (mind). So in the materially bound state, the bewildered soul does not direct the intellect in the proper direction. Thus, the senses decide the direction where the chariot will go. The soul experiences the pleasures of the senses vicariously, but these do not satisfy it. Seated on this chariot, the soul (passenger) is moving around in this material world since eternity..\nHowever, if the soul wakes up to its higher nature and decides to take a proactive role, it can exercise the intellect in the proper direction. The intellect will then govern the lower self\u2014the mind and the senses\u2014and the chariot will move in the direction of eternal welfare. In this way, the higher self (soul) must be used to control the lower self (senses, mind, and, intellect)..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, where success is often measured by material gains, it's easy for desires and lust to take over our thoughts and actions. However, Shree Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita remind us that true fulfillment can only be found through knowledge of the self.\n\nThe verse 3.43 encourages us to recognize that the soul is superior to the material intellect and to subdue our lower self (senses, mind, and intellect) by the higher self (strength of the soul). This means that we should use our divine nature to control our desires and lust instead of letting them control us.\n\nIn the modern context, this can be applied in various ways. For instance, we can train our minds to focus on long-term goals rather than short-term pleasures. We can also learn to detach ourselves from material possessions and recognize that true happiness comes from within.\n\nMoreover, just as Shree Krishna's analogy of the chariot helps us understand how the soul, intellect, mind, and senses are interconnected, we can use this model to analyze our own thoughts and actions. By identifying which part of us is driving our decisions, we can make a conscious effort to take control and steer ourselves in the right direction.\n\nIn summary, Shree Krishna's teachings on controlling lust through knowledge of the self are relevant and applicable in the modern world. By recognizing the superiority of the soul over the material intellect and using our divine nature to subdue our lower self, we can find true fulfillment and success in all aspects of life.", "startup": "In today's world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita can be interpreted as a call to overcome our desires and cravings, which are often driven by lust. In the context of startups and entrepreneurship, this can mean refraining from making decisions solely based on material gains or personal ambition. Instead, we should focus on aligning our actions with our higher self, or spiritual nature, which seeks true fulfillment and purpose beyond temporary pleasures. By training our intellect to think in this way and using it to control our mind and senses, we can make more conscious and values-based choices that benefit not just ourselves but also society as a whole. This requires constant introspection and self-reflection, much like the chariot analogy in the Upanishads, where the soul must take an active role in guiding the intellect and controlling the lower self. Ultimately, this verse encourages us to prioritize our spiritual wellbeing over material gains and strive towards a more meaningful and fulfilling life.", "personal": "In today's world, the concept of controlling our desires and impulses through the power of the soul is just as relevant. The verse from Bhagavad Gita, \"Thus knowing the soul to be superior to the material intellect, O mighty armed Arjun, subdue the lower self (senses, mind, and intellect) by the higher self (strength of the soul), and kill this formidable enemy called lust,\" encourages us to recognize that our true nature is spiritual and divine. This realization allows us to overcome the material desires that lead to suffering and attachment.\n\nIn modern times, we are bombarded with endless distractions and temptations that can easily consume us if we allow them to. Social media, for example, can be a powerful tool for connecting with others, but it can also become an addiction that drains our time and energy. Similarly, material possessions and pleasures can provide temporary satisfaction, but they cannot fulfill the deepest longings of the soul.\n\nTo apply this verse in our daily lives, we need to cultivate self-discipline and self-control. This involves training our mind to focus on what truly matters and to let go of distractions that do not serve us. We can start by setting clear boundaries around our time and energy, prioritizing activities that align with our values and goals, and practicing mindfulness to stay present in the moment.\n\nAdditionally, we can learn to recognize the signs of attachment and craving, and to respond with compassionate detachment. This means acknowledging our desires without being consumed by them, and choosing instead to act from a place of wisdom and self-awareness. By doing so, we can cultivate inner strength and resilience, and live a more fulfilling and purposeful life.\n\nIn summary, the verse from Bhagavad Gita encourages us to recognize the power of the soul in controlling our desires and impulses, and to apply this knowledge in our daily lives through self-discipline, self-control, and compassionate detachment.

The verse from Bhagavad Gita, \"Thus knowing the soul to be superior to the material intellect, O mighty armed Arjun, subdue the lower self (senses, mind, and intellect) by the higher self (strength of the soul), and kill this formidable enemy called lust,\" can be interpreted as follows:\n\nIn our modern society, we are constantly bombarded with materialistic desires and pleasures. These desires can lead to attachment and craving, which in turn can cause suffering. The Bhagavad Gita teaches us that the soul is divine in nature and seeks divine bliss. Material objects cannot fulfill this longing, as they are temporary and impermanent.\n\nTo overcome our materialistic desires, we need to develop a higher consciousness or self-awareness. This involves training our intellect to think beyond material pleasures and towards spiritual values. We can then use this higher consciousness to control our mind and senses.\n\nThe analogy of the chariot in the Upanishads is still relevant today. Our body is like a chariot, pulled by the five senses or horses. The reins in their mouths are the mind, which should guide the horses towards spiritual goals. However, in modern times, we often let our senses and desires control us, leading to suffering and dissatisfaction.\n\nTo overcome this, we need to develop a strong intellect that can govern our lower self or senses. This involves cultivating qualities like detachment, self-control, and discipline. We should also learn to distinguish between spiritual values and materialistic desires. By doing so, we can develop a higher consciousness and control our lower self, leading to inner peace and fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bhagavad Gita's teachings on controlling our desires and impulses are still relevant in today's modern world.

The recipients of that knowledge must appreciate its value and have faith in its authenticity. Only then will they put in the effort required to implement it practically in their lives. In this verse, Shree Krishna establishes the credibility and importance of the spiritual wisdom he is bestowing on Arjun. Shree Krishna informs Arjun that the knowledge being imparted unto him is not newly created for the convenience of motivating him into battle. It is the same eternal science of Yog that he originally taught to Vivasvan, or Surya, Sun God, who imparted it to Manu, the original progenitor of humankind; Manu in turn taught it to Ikshvaku, first king of the Solar dynasty. This is the descending process of knowledge, where someone who is a perfect authority on the knowledge passes it down to another who wishes to know..\nIn contrast to this is the ascending process of acquiring knowledge, where one endeavors to enhance the frontiers of understanding through self-effort. The ascending process is laborious, imperfect, and time-consuming. For example, if we wish to learn Physics, we could either try to do it by the ascending process, where we speculate about its principles with our own intellect and then reach conclusions, or we could do it by the descending process, where we approach a good teacher of the subject. The ascending process is exceedingly time-consuming, and we may not even be able to complete the inquiry in our lifetime. We can also not be sure about the validity of our conclusions. In comparison, the descending process gives us instant access to the deepest secrets of Physics. If our teacher has perfect knowledge of Physics, then it is very straightforward\u2014simply listen to the science from him and digest what he says. This descending process of receiving knowledge is both easy and faultless..\nEvery year, thousands of self-help books are released in the market, which present the authors\u2019 solutions to the problems encountered in life. These books may be helpful in a limited way, but because they are based upon the ascending process of attaining knowledge, they are imperfect. Every few years, a new theory comes along that overthrows the current ones. This ascending process is unsuitable for knowing the Absolute Truth. Divine knowledge does not need to be created by self-effort. It is the energy of God, and has existed ever since he has existed, just as heat and light are as old as the fire from which they emanate..\nGod and the individual soul are both eternal, and so the science of Yog that unites the soul and God is also eternal. There is no need to speculate and formulate new theories about it. An amazing endorsement of this truism is the Bhagavad Gita itself, which continues to astound people with the sagacity of its perennial wisdom that remains relevant to our daily lives even fifty centuries after it was spoken.

We may wonder how these teachings could have originated from a single source or whether they are truly authentic.\n\nShree Krishna's response to Arjun's query in the Gita provides us with insights into this issue. He explains that the divine descends into the world periodically, taking on different forms and appearing as various spiritual teachers or avatars. These avatars are not just historical figures but also embodiments of divine consciousness, which is eternal and unchanging.\n\nIn the modern context, we can see this principle at work in the way that spiritual teachings have been transmitted across cultures and traditions. Many of these teachings share common themes and principles, suggesting a deeper underlying source. For example, the concepts of karma, dharma, and reincarnation are found in both Hinduism and Buddhism, despite their apparent differences.\n\nMoreover, we can also see this principle at work in the way that spiritual teachings have been adapted and transformed over time to suit different cultural contexts.

After all, science and technology have advanced so much since then that many of our current beliefs and practices seem to contradict the Gita's ancient wisdom.\n\nTo answer this question, we must remember that the Bhagavad Gita is not just a historical text but also a spiritual one. Its teachings are timeless and universal, applicable to all people in all ages. Shree Krishna's statement about teaching Vivasvan doesn't mean that he was physically present on Earth during the Sun god's time; rather, it refers to the eternal nature of knowledge.

By studying spiritual texts like Bhagavad Gita, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the soul and God, which will help us distinguish between human limitations and divine attributes.\n\nIn summary, verse 4.5 from Bhagavad Gita teaches us that there is a fundamental difference between our individual selves and the divine consciousness, but both are eternal, conscious, and blissful. By recognizing this distinction, we can approach spiritual leaders with respect and reverence, and use the sword of knowledge to overcome doubts and ignorance.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita can teach us about the difference between our individual selves and the divine. Just as Shree Krishna emphasized that he is not just another human being despite appearing in a physical form, we too should recognize that there is more to us than just our physical bodies. Our true self, or soul, is eternal, sentient, and blissful, but it is limited by its individual consciousness. On the other hand, God is all-pervading, all-powerful, and omniscient.\n\nIn the modern world, this understanding can help us navigate our personal relationships. We often make assumptions about others based on their physical appearance or behavior, forgetting that they too have a divine spark within them. By recognizing this truth, we can treat others with more compassion and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.\n\nMoreover, in today's fast-paced world, it is easy to get caught up in our own thoughts and forget the bigger picture. Shree Krishna's words to Arjun, \"Parantapa,\" can inspire us to overcome our doubts and fears, just as Arjun did on the battlefield. By using the sword of knowledge, which comes from studying scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita, we too can conquer our inner demons and be situated in wisdom.\n\nIn summary, this verse teaches us that there is more to life than meets the eye, and by recognizing the divine within ourselves and others, we can cultivate a deeper sense of compassion and wisdom in our personal relationships.", "student": "In today's world, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita can teach us an important lesson about our true identity beyond our physical body and temporary experiences. Just as Shree Krishna explains that he and Arjun have had many past lives, but only Krishna remembers them all, we too have had numerous experiences in this material world. However, due to the forgetfulness caused by Maya or illusion, we often identify ourselves solely with our current body and circumstances.\n\nIn modern times, this can lead to a sense of confusion and dissatisfaction as we chase after temporary pleasures and material possessions, believing that they will bring us lasting happiness. However, just as Krishna's divine attributes and powers are not diminished by his temporary descent into the material world, our true self or soul is also eternal, sentient, and blissful beyond our physical body and experiences.\n\nThis verse can inspire us to cultivate self-reflection and introspection, recognizing that we are more than just our current circumstances and experiences. By remembering our past lives and the knowledge of our true identity as a soul connected to God, we can find inner peace and fulfillment beyond the fleeting pleasures of this world.\n\nFurthermore, in today's world where skepticism and doubt about spirituality is common, this verse can also help us refute such doubts by emphasizing the difference between the individual soul and God. Just as we do not mistake a president visiting a prison for a convict, we should not equate human beings with God simply because they are in a physical form like ours. By recognizing the differences between the soul and God, we can develop a deeper understanding and reverence for the divine.\n\nIn summary, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita teaches us to recognize our true identity beyond the temporary experiences of this world, refute doubts about spirituality, and cultivate inner peace and fulfillment by remembering our past lives and our connection to God."}}, "4.6": {"sanskrit": " \u0905\u091c\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e \u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0928\u094d |\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0927\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u092f \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u092e\u093e\u092f\u092f\u093e || 6||.\najo \u2019pi sannavyay\u0101tm\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u012b\u015bhvaro \u2019pi sanprak\u1e5biti\u1e41 sv\u0101m adhi\u1e63h\u1e6dh\u0101ya sambhav\u0101my\u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101.\najo \u2019pi sannavyayatma bhutanam ishvaro \u2019pi sanprakritim svam adhishthaya sambhavamyatma-mayaya.", "english": " Although I am unborn, the Lord of all living entities, and have an imperishable nature, yet I appear in this world by virtue of Yogmaya, My divine power.\n                        .\nMany people revolt at the idea of a God who possesses a form. They are more comfortable with a formless God, who is all-pervading, incorporeal, and subtle. God is definitely incorporeal and formless, but that does not mean that he cannot simultaneously have a form as well. Since God is all-powerful, he has the power to manifest in a form if he wishes. If someone stipulates that God cannot have a form, it means that person does not accept him as all-powerful. Thus to say, \u201cGod is formless,\u201d is an incomplete statement. On the other hand, to say, \u201cGod manifests in a personal form,\u201d is also only a partial truth. The all-powerful God has both aspects to his divine personality\u2014the personal form and the formless aspect. Hence, the B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:.\ndwe v\u0101va brahma\u1e47o r\u016bpe m\u016brta\u1e41 chaiva am\u016brta\u1e41 cha  (2.3.1)[v3].\n\u201cGod appears in both ways\u2014as the formless Brahman and as the personal God.\u201d They are both dimensions of his personality..\nIn fact, the individual soul also has these two dimensions to its existence. It is formless, and hence, when it leaves the body upon death, it cannot be seen. Yet it takes on a body\u2014not once, but innumerable times\u2014as it transmigrates from birth to birth. When the tiny soul is able to possess a body, can the all-powerful God not have a form? Or is it that God says, \u201cI do not have the power to manifest in a form, and hence I am only a formless light.\u201d For him to be perfect and complete, he must be both personal and formless..\nThe difference is that while our form is created from the material energy, Maya, God\u2019s form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya. It is thus divine, and beyond material defects. This has been nicely stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47:.\nyastu nirgu\u1e47a ityukta\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101stre\u1e63hu jagad\u012b\u015bhvara\u1e25.\npr\u0101k\u1e5bitairheya sanyuktairgu\u1e47airh\u012bnatvamuchyate  [v4].\n\u201cWherever the Vedic scriptures state that God does not have a form, they imply that his form is not subject to the blemishes of the material energy; rather, it is a divine form.\u201d.\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "The verse 4.6 from Bhagavad Gita speaks about the dual nature of God - both unborn and imperishable, yet appearing in this world through His divine power, Yogmaya. In modern context, this can be understood as the concept that while God is ultimately formless and beyond material limitations, He also has the ability to manifest in a personal form. This is similar to how our individual soul has both formless and formed aspects. The difference lies in the fact that while our forms are created from the material energy, Maya, God's form is created by His divine energy, Yogmaya. This divine form is beyond material defects and blemishes, as stated in the Padma Purana. In essence, this verse highlights the all-encompassing nature of God - both personal and formless at the same time.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, this understanding can have practical applications in various fields, especially in the corporate world. It can help individuals to view God as a source of guidance and support in their professional endeavors, while also recognizing His divine nature beyond material limitations. This can lead to a more holistic approach towards work, where success is not just measured by material gains but also by spiritual values such as honesty, integrity, and compassion. Ultimately, the teachings of Bhagavad Gita, including this verse, provide a framework for individuals to navigate through the complexities of modern life while staying grounded in their spiritual beliefs.", "startup": "In modern terms, this verse from Bhagavad Gita (4.6) speaks to the concept of God's divine nature and ability to manifest in both a personal form and an unmanifested, formless state. While some may find comfort in the idea of a formless God, this does not negate the fact that God has the power to take on a physical form if he chooses. This is because God's power is all-encompassing and infinite, allowing him to exist in both forms simultaneously.\n\nIn the context of modern society, this verse can be applied to our own human experiences. Just as God has both personal and formless aspects, so too do we as individuals have both a physical body and an intangible soul. Our bodies are subject to decay and impermanence, while our souls are eternal and unchanging. This duality is reflected in the verse from Bhagavad Gita, which highlights the interconnectedness between God's divine nature and his ability to manifest in different forms.\n\nFurthermore, this concept can be applied to the startup world as well. Just as God has both personal and formless aspects, so too do successful startups often have a clear vision or mission statement (the \"personal\" aspect) while also being adaptable and flexible in response to changing circumstances (the \"formless\" aspect). This duality allows for growth and evolution, while still maintaining a strong sense of purpose and identity.\n\nIn summary, the verse from Bhagavad Gita speaks to the complexity and multifaceted nature of God's divine personality, and can be applied to our own human experiences as well as the world of startups and entrepreneurship.

This verse highlights the dual nature of God - both formless and with a divine form. In the modern context, this understanding can help us appreciate the complexity and multifacetedness of God's existence. It challenges our preconceived notions about what God should be like and encourages us to embrace the mystery and wonder of his divine personality. This verse also reminds us that while we may struggle with reconciling the idea of a personal God with the concept of an all-pervading, formless deity, both aspects are true and essential parts of his nature. Ultimately, this verse invites us to deepen our understanding and reverence for the divine, recognizing that there is always more to discover about the infinite and mysterious nature of God.", "student": "The verse 4.6 from Bhagavad Gita speaks about the dual nature of God - both unborn and imperishable with an eternal and divine essence, yet appearing in this material world through His divine power called Yogmaya.

This does not mean that God is limited by matter or subject to its imperfections, but rather that His divine nature transcends the material realm while also being able to interact with it. It's a reminder that God is both personal and formless, and that His power and presence can be experienced in both ways.

The sage Narad is an example of \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r. The Buddha is also an example of \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r..\n2. Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014these are the descensions of God in the personal form, where he displays some of his divine powers. Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101rs are also of two kinds:.\na) Where God reveals himself only for a few moments, completes his work, and then departs. Hansavatar is an example of this, where God manifested before the Kumaras, answered their question, and left..\nb) Where the Avatar remains on the earth for many years. Ved Vyas, who wrote the eighteen Puranas and the Mahabharat, and divided the Vedas into four parts, is an example of such an Avatar..\n3. Vaibhavat\u0101r\u2014when God descends in his divine form, and manifests more of his divine powers. Matsyavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahavatar are all examples of Vaibhavat\u0101rs..\n4. Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014when God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form. Shree Krishna, Shree Ram, and Nrisinghavatar are all Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r..\nThis classification does not imply that any one Avat\u0101r is bigger than the other.

This is a sign that dharma, or righteousness, is decreasing while adharma, or unrighteousness, is increasing.

This concept of divine intervention is called an Avatar.\n\nIn Hinduism, there are four types of Avatars: 1) Aveeshavaatar, where God manifests his powers in an individual soul; 2) Prabhavavaatar, where God reveals himself for a few moments or remains on earth for many years to display divine powers; 3) Vaibhavataar, where God manifests more of his divine powers; and 4) Paravasthaaavatar, where God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form.\n\nThese Avatars are not ranked based on their power or significance, as Ved Vyas, an Avatar himself, stated that all the descensions of God are replete with all divine powers and are perfect and complete.

They embody the qualities of dharma, such as truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion, and inspire others to follow these principles.\n\nMoreover, in the context of startups and entrepreneurship, we can interpret this verse as a call to action for individuals who wish to make a positive impact on society. When there is a decline in righteousness, it becomes the responsibility of entrepreneurs to create innovative solutions that address social issues and promote dharma. By doing so, they become Avatars in their own right, working towards reestablishing dharma in their respective fields.\n\nIn summary, this verse from Bhagavad Gita encourages us to be aware of the decline in righteousness and take responsibility for restoring balance and order through our actions, whether it be through social activism or entrepreneurship.

However, if we closely study these three points, none of the three reasons seem very convincing:.\nTo protect the righteous. God is seated in the hearts of his devotees, and always protects them from within. There is no need to take an Avatar for this purpose..\nTo annihilate the wicked. God is all-powerful, and can kill the wicked merely by wishing it. Why should he have to take an Avatar to accomplish this?.\nTo establish dharma.  Dharma is eternally described in the Vedas.

Let\u2019s delve a little deeper to grasp the import of what Shree Krishna is stating..\nThe biggest dharma that the soul can engage in is devotion to God. That is what God strengthens by taking an Avat\u0101r. When God descends in the world, he reveals his divine forms, names, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and associates. This provides the souls with an easy basis for devotion. Since the mind needs a form to focus upon and to connect with, the formless aspect of God is very difficult to worship. On the other hand, devotion to the personal form of God is easy for people to comprehend, simple to perform, and sweet to engage in..\nThus, since the descension of Lord Krishna 5,000 years ago, billions of souls have made his divine leelas (pastimes) as the basis of their devotion, and purified their minds with ease and joy. Similarly, the Ramayan has provided the souls with a popular basis for devotion for innumerable centuries. When the TV show, Ramayan, first began airing on Indian national television on Sunday mornings, all the streets of India would become empty. The pastimes of Lord Ram held such fascination for the people that they would be glued to their television sets to see the leelas on the screen. This reveals how Lord Ram\u2019s descension provided the basis for devotion to billions of souls in history. The Ramayan says:.\nr\u0101m eka t\u0101pasa tiya t\u0101r\u012b, n\u0101ma ko\u1e6di khala kumati sudh\u0101r\u012b [v7].\n\u201cIn his descension period, Lord Ram helped only one Ahalya (Sage Gautam\u2019s wife, whom Lord Ram released from the body of stone). However, since then, by chanting the divine name \u201cRam,\u201d billions of fallen souls have elevated themselves.\u201d So a deeper understanding of this verse is:.\nTo establish dharma: God descends to establish the dharma of devotion by providing souls with his names, forms, pastimes, virtues, abodes, and associates, with the help of which they may engage in bhakti and purify their minds..\nTo kill the wicked: Along with God, to help facilitate his divine pastimes, some liberated Saints descend and pretend to be miscreants. For example, Ravan and Kumbhakarna were Jaya and Vijaya who descended from the divine abode of God. They pretended to be demons and opposed and fought with Ram. They could not have been killed by anyone else, since they were divine personalities. So, God slayed such demons as a part of his leelas. And having killed them, he sent them to his divine abode, since that was where they came from in the first place..\nTo protect the righteous: Many souls had become sufficiently elevated in their s\u0101dhan\u0101 (spiritual practice) to qualify to meet God face-to-face. When Shree Krishna descended in the world, these eligible souls got their first opportunity to participate in God\u2019s divine pastimes. For example, some gop\u012bs (cowherd women of Vrindavan, where Shree Krishna manifested his pastimes) were liberated souls who had descended from the divine abode to assist in Shree Krishna\u2019s leelas. Other gop\u012bs were materially bound souls who got their first chance to meet and serve God, and participate in his leelas. So when Shree Krishna descended in the world, such qualified souls got the opportunity to perfect their devotion by directly participating in the pastimes of God..\nThis is the deeper meaning of the verse.

Our mind gets cleansed by engaging it in devotional remembrance of God. This devotion can either be toward the formless aspect of God or toward his personal form. Devotion toward the formless is intangible and nebulous to most people. They find nothing to focus upon or feel connected with during such devotional meditation. Devotion to the personal form of God is tangible and simple. Such devotion requires divine sentiments toward the personality of God. For people to engage in devotion to Shree Krishna, they must develop divine feelings toward his names, form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates. For example, people purify their minds by worshipping stone deities because they harbor the divine sentiments that God resides in these deities. It is these sentiments that purify the devotee\u2019s mind. The progenitor Manu says:.\nna k\u0101\u1e63h\u1e6dhe vidyate devo na \u015bhil\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 na m\u1e5bitsu chabh\u0101ve hi vidyate devastasm\u0101tbh\u0101va\u1e41 sam\u0101charet [v8].\n\u201cGod resides neither in wood nor in stone, but in a devotional heart. Hence, worship the deity with loving sentiments.\u201d.\nSimilarly, if we wish to engage in devotion toward Lord Krishna, we must learn to harbor divine sentiments toward his leelas. Those commentators who give a figurative interpretation to the Mahabharat and the Bhagavad Gita, do grave injustice by destroying the basis of people\u2019s faith in devotion toward Shree Krishna. In this verse, Shree Krishna has emphasized the need for divine sentiments toward his pastimes, for enhancing our devotion..\nTo develop such divine feelings, we must understand the difference between God\u2019s actions and ours. We materially bound souls have not yet attained divine bliss, and hence the longing of our soul is not yet satiated. Thus, our actions are motivated by self-interest and the desire for personal fulfillment. However, God\u2019s actions have no personal motive because he is perfectly satiated by the infinite bliss of his own personality. He does not need to achieve further personal bliss by performing actions. Therefore, whatever he does is for the welfare of the materially conditioned souls. Such divine actions that God performs are termed as \u201cleelas\u201d while the actions we perform are called \u201cwork.\u201d.\nSimilarly, God\u2019s birth is also divine, and unlike ours, it does not take place from a mother\u2019s womb. The all-Blissful God has no requirement to hang upside down in a mother\u2019s womb. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:.\ntam adbhuta\u1e41 b\u0101lakam ambujek\u1e63ha\u1e47a\u1e41chatur-bhuja\u1e41 \u015bha\u1e45kha gad\u0101dyud\u0101yudham(10.3.9) [v9].\n\u201cWhen Shree Krishna manifested upon birth before Vasudev and Devaki, he was in his four-armed Vishnu form.\u201d This full-sized form could definitely not have resided in Devaki\u2019s womb. However, to create in her the feeling that he was there, by his Yogmaya power, he simply kept expanding Devaki\u2019s womb. Finally, he manifested from the outside, revealing that he had never been inside her:.\n\u0101vir\u0101s\u012bd yath\u0101 pr\u0101chy\u0101\u1e41 di\u015bh\u012bndur iva pu\u1e63hkala\u1e25(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.3.8) [v10].\n\u201cAs the moon manifests in its full glory in the night sky, similarly the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna manifested before Devaki and Vasudev.\u201d This is the divine nature of God\u2019s birth. If we can develop faith in the divinity of his pastimes and birth, then we will be able to easily engage in devotion to his personal form, and attain the supreme destination..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's world, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita has relevance in promoting spiritual growth and self-realization.

He now confirms that legions of human beings in all ages became God-realized by this means. They achieved this goal by purifying their minds through devotion. Shree Aurobindo put it very nicely: \u201cYou must keep the temple of the heart clean, if you wish to install therein the living presence.\u201d The Bible states: \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\u201d (Matthew 5.8) [v11].\nNow, how does the mind get purified? By giving up attachment, fear, and anger, and absorbing the mind in God. Actually, attachment is the cause of both fear and anger. Fear arises out of apprehension that the object of our attachment will be snatched away from us. And anger arises when there is an obstruction in attaining the object of our attachment. Attachment is thus the root cause of the mind getting dirty..\nThis world of Maya consists of the three modes of material nature\u2014sattva, rajas, and tamas (goodness, passion, and ignorance). All objects and personalities in the world come within the realm of these three modes. When we attach our mind to a material object or person, our mind too becomes affected by the three modes. Instead, when we absorb the same mind in God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, such devotion purifies the mind. Thus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord. Hence, the Ramayan states:.\nprema bhagati jala binu raghur\u0101\u012b, abhiantara mala kabahu\u00f1 na j\u0101\u012b.\n\u201cWithout devotion to God, the dirt of the mind will not be washed away.\u201d Even the ardent propagator of j\u00f1\u0101na yog, Shankaracharya, stated:.\n\u015bhuddhayati hi n\u0101ntar\u0101tm\u0101 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47apad\u0101mbhoja bhaktim\u1e5bite (Prabodh Sudh\u0101kar)[v13].\n\u201cWithout engaging in devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, the mind will not be cleansed.\u201d.\nOn reading the previous verse, a question may arise whether Lord Krishna is partial in bestowing his grace upon those who absorb their minds in him versus the worldly-minded souls.

In the modern context, this can be seen in how individuals approach their work and careers. Some may view their job as just a means of earning money and providing for themselves and their families. They may not see any higher purpose or spiritual significance in their work. However, Lord Krishna's law of karma still applies to them. Their actions have consequences, whether positive or negative, that will eventually be reflected back to them.\n\nOn the other hand, some individuals view their work as a way to serve others and contribute to society. They may see their job as a form of worship or service to God. Lord Krishna acknowledges and reciprocates with these individuals in a special way. He helps them overcome obstacles, removes negative karma, and provides divine bliss, knowledge, and love.\n\nIn the corporate world, this can be seen in how some successful businesspeople attribute their success to a higher power or spirituality. They may view their work as a form of service to society, rather than just a means of earning money. Lord Krishna's teachings encourage individuals to approach their work with a sense of purpose and selflessness, rather than just selfish ambition.\n\nIn summary, Lord Krishna's verse 4.11 reminds us that our actions have consequences, whether we consciously offer them as devotion or not.

For those who do not believe in a traditional concept of God, the universe still operates according to natural laws and principles, which can be seen as a form of divine order or harmony. These individuals may find meaning and purpose in serving others, pursuing their passions, or working towards a greater cause.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who choose to surrender themselves to a higher power through religious practices or spiritual disciplines, they receive support and guidance from that power. This can take many forms, such as inner peace, wisdom, or material blessings. Ultimately, the key is to find a path that resonates with one's values and beliefs, and to approach it with sincerity and devotion.\n\nThe verse also highlights the idea that everyone is ultimately serving something greater than themselves, whether they realize it or not.

This means that every action has a reaction, and we will reap what we sow. However, these atheists are still serving God in some way, whether it's through their attachment to material possessions or relationships. They may not realize it, but they are still surrendering themselves to something greater than themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who turn towards God as their goal and refuge, Krishna promises to serve them by destroying their past karma, freeing them from the bonds of Maya (illusion), and bestowing divine bliss, knowledge, and love. This is a reminder that true surrender requires selfless love and devotion, which allows us to become enslaved to God's love in return.\n\nKrishna also explains that he serves those who perform even one act of devotion towards him. This means that no matter how small or insignificant our acts of service may seem, they still have the potential to bring us closer to God.\n\nIn today's world, where many people worship celestial gods instead of Krishna, this verse reminds us that all paths lead back to the same source. Ultimately, it doesn't matter which deity we choose to worship; what matters is our intention and level of devotion. As long as we surrender ourselves to something greater than ourselves, whether it's God or a higher power, we will receive his blessings in return.\n\nIn summary, Lord Krishna's statement that he reciprocates with everyone based on how they surrender to him is a powerful reminder of the importance of surrendering ourselves to something greater than ourselves, regardless of whether we believe in God or not.

However, Farid realized that since Akbar was already seeking these things from God, there was no point in asking him for anything else.

There are the philosophers who are the communist party think-tanks, there are the military men who protect the country, there are the farmers who engage in agriculture, and there are the factory workers..\nThe Vedic philosophy explains this variety in a more scientific manner. It states that the material energy is constituted of three gu\u1e47as (modes): sattva gu\u1e47a (mode of goodness), rajo gu\u1e47a (mode of passion), and tamo gu\u1e47a (mode of ignorance). The Brahmins are those who have a preponderance of the mode of goodness. They are predisposed toward teaching and worship. The Kshatriyas are those who have a preponderance of the mode of passion mixed with a smaller amount of the mode of goodness. They are inclined toward administration and management. The Vaishyas are those who possess the mode of passion mixed with some mode of ignorance. Accordingly, they form the business and agricultural class. Then there are the Shudras, who are predominated by the mode of ignorance. They form the working class. This classification was neither meant to be according to birth, nor was it unchangeable.

This is similar to the rain. Just as rain water falls equally on the forest, yet from some seeds huge banyan trees sprout, from other seeds beautiful flowers bloom, and from some thorny bushes emerge. The rain, which is impartial, is not answerable for this difference. In the same way, God provides the souls with the energy to act, but they are free in determining what they wish to do with it; God is not responsible for their actions..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita has relevance in understanding the concept of natural talents and career choices. The verse explains that there are four categories of occupations based on a person's qualities and activities, rather than their birth or social status. This idea is similar to the concept of identifying one's strengths and weaknesses to choose a career path that aligns with their natural abilities.\n\nIn modern society, we see people excelling in various fields such as science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), arts, sports, and business. These fields require different skill sets and personalities. Some individuals have a natural inclination towards creativity, while others are more analytical or practical. The verse from Bhagavad Gita suggests that these differences arise due to the three modes of material energy: goodness, passion, and ignorance.\n\nThe Brahmins, who possess a preponderance of the mode of goodness, are inclined towards teaching and worship. They may excel in fields such as education, research, or spirituality. The Kshatriyas, with a preponderance of the mode of passion mixed with goodness, are suited for administrative and management roles. They may be successful in fields like politics, law, or business. The Vaishyas, who have a mix of passion and ignorance, may excel in agriculture, finance, or entrepreneurship. Finally, the Shudras, dominated by ignorance, may be well-suited for manual labor, service industries, or technical roles that require practical skills.\n\nIt is essential to note that this classification is not meant to be rigid or based on birth. Individuals can change their occupations and develop new skills over time. The verse from Bhagavad Gita also emphasizes that God is the creator of this system but is not responsible for one's actions. It highlights the importance of personal choice and responsibility in determining one's career path.\n\nIn summary, the concept of natural talents and career choices can be understood through the lens of Bhagavad Gita's verse on the four categories of occupations based on people's qualities and activities.

This concept is not just limited to traditional categories like Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras, but it applies to any occupation or field of work.\n\nFor example, some people have a natural inclination towards leadership and decision-making, making them well-suited for roles in management or politics. Others may excel in creative fields like art, music, or design due to their artistic nature. Still, others may find fulfillment in more practical pursuits such as farming, engineering, or medicine.\n\nThis verse also highlights the idea that while God is the creator of this system, He is not responsible for our actions. We have free will and can choose how we use the energy and resources provided to us. This principle applies equally to individuals working in startups, where success is often determined by one's own efforts and decision-making abilities rather than external factors.\n\nIn a startup environment, this concept of recognizing different types of roles based on inherent qualities can be particularly beneficial for building effective teams. By understanding each team member's strengths and weaknesses, leaders can assign tasks that play to their individual talents and help the company achieve its goals more efficiently. Additionally, this approach can foster a sense of collaboration and respect among team members as they recognize and appreciate the unique contributions of their colleagues.\n\nIn summary, the verse from the Bhagavad Gita encourages us to acknowledge and celebrate the diverse range of professions and roles in society while recognizing that success is ultimately determined by our own choices and actions.

This classification is not determined by birth but rather by one's inherent qualities and activities.\n\nIn modern society, we often strive for equality and try to level the playing field for everyone. However, it's important to acknowledge that people are not all the same and have different strengths and weaknesses. By recognizing these differences and allowing individuals to pursue their passions, we can create a more productive and fulfilling society.\n\nThe concept of the non-doer God also applies in today's world. While God may provide us with opportunities and resources, it's ultimately up to us to determine how we use them. We are free to choose our own path in life and take responsibility for our actions. Just as rain falls equally on all, but some seeds grow into beautiful flowers while others become thorny bushes, God is not responsible for the outcomes of our choices. It's up to us to cultivate the good qualities within us and avoid ignorance and passion that can lead to negative consequences.\n\nIn summary, the principles of the Bhagavad Gita continue to be relevant in today's world as they offer a scientific understanding of human nature and provide guidance on how to live a fulfilling life.

Others may have a passion for leadership and administration, which could lead to successful careers in management or politics. Some individuals may excel in agriculture or farming, while others may thrive in the business world.

The modern world may have different occupational opportunities than ancient times, but the principles of identifying and utilizing one's strengths remain relevant today.\n\nFurthermore, the concept that God is the creator of this system but remains a non-doer highlights the importance of personal responsibility and free will. While God provides us with the energy to act, it is up to us to determine how we use it. This principle encourages individuals to take ownership of their actions and decisions, rather than blaming external factors for their circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the principles behind the varnasrama system remain relevant in modern society as they emphasize identifying one's natural inclinations, utilizing them accordingly, and taking personal responsibility for one's actions."}}, "4.14": {"sanskrit": " \u0928 \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0932\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0928 \u092e\u0947 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092b\u0932\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u092a\u0943\u0939\u093e |\u0907\u0924\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u092f\u094b\u093d\u092d\u093f\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0928 \u0938 \u092c\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 || 14||.\nna m\u0101\u1e41 karm\u0101\u1e47i limpanti na me karma-phale sp\u1e5bih\u0101iti m\u0101\u1e41 yo \u2019bhij\u0101n\u0101ti karmabhir na sa badhyate.\nna mam karmani limpanti na me karma-phale sprihaiti mam yo \u2019bhijanati karmabhir na sa badhyate.", "english": " Activities do not taint Me, nor do I desire the fruits of action.

Similarly, if we offer impure objects into the fire, it still retains its purity\u2014the fire is pure, and whatever we pour into it also gets purified. In the same manner, numerous gutters of rainwater merge into the holy Ganges, but this does not make the Ganges a gutter\u2014the Ganges is pure and in transforms all those dirty gutters into the holy Ganges. Likewise, God is not tainted by the activities he performs..\nActivities bind one in karmic reactions when they are performed with the mentality of enjoying the results. However, God\u2019s actions are not motivated by selfishness; his every act is driven by compassion for the souls. Therefore, although he administers the world directly or indirectly, and engages in all kinds of activities in the process, he is never tainted by any reactions. Lord Krishna states here that he is transcendental to the fruitive reactions of work..\nEven Saints who are situated in God-consciousness become transcendental to the material energy. Since all their activities are effectuated in love for God, such pure-hearted Saints are not bound by the fruitive reactions of work.

Just like God, who is pure and performs all his activities out of compassion, our actions also have the potential to purify us and those around us. However, this only happens when we perform them without any selfish motives. The verse emphasizes that a true understanding of God's nature can help us overcome the effects of karma and attain liberation.

This concept can be seen in our daily lives through examples such as sunlight not being tainted by falling on impure substances, fire still retaining its purity even when impure objects are thrown into it, and the holy Ganges remaining pure despite merging with dirty gutters of rainwater. Similarly, a person who knows God in this way is not bound by the karmic reactions of their actions because they perform them without attachment to the results, unlike those who act out of selfishness. This principle also applies to saintly persons who are situated in God-consciousness as their pure intentions and love for God make them transcendental to material energy and its effects. Ultimately, God's own actions are not bound by karmic reactions because He is beyond the influence of material energy and acts according to His own sweet will.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita teaches us that our actions should not be motivated by selfish desires or the desire for personal gain.

This means that we are not bound by karma or its reactions because our intentions are pure.\n\nIn modern society, where success and achievement are often measured by material gains, it can be challenging to maintain this perspective. However, by remembering the ultimate goal of self-realization and serving God, we can ensure that our actions remain pure and free from attachment.

There is one kind of inaction where persons look upon their social duties as burdensome, and renounce them out of indolence. They give up actions physically, but their mind continues to contemplate upon the objects of the senses. Such persons may appear to be inactive, but their lethargic idleness is actually sinful action.

There is another kind of inaction performed by karm yogis. They execute their social duties without attachment to results, dedicating the fruits of their actions to God. Although engaged in all kinds of activities, they are not entangled in karmic reactions, since they have no motive for personal enjoyment. There were many great kings in Indian history\u2014Dhruv, Prahlad, Yudhisthir, Prithu, and Ambarish\u2014who discharged their kingly duties to the best of their abilities, and yet because their minds were not entangled in material desires, their actions were termed Akarm, or inaction.

However, true wisdom lies in understanding the concept of \"action in inaction\" and \"inaction in action.\"\n\nFirstly, let's discuss \"action in inaction.\" This refers to situations where we may feel overwhelmed by our responsibilities or tasks, leading us to procrastinate or avoid them altogether. We might think that taking a break or doing nothing is the best course of action, but this can actually lead to negative consequences. If we let our duties pile up and ignore them, it can create stress and anxiety in the long run. Moreover, if we don't fulfill our social responsibilities, it can lead to negative karma and harm our reputation. Therefore, true wisdom lies in recognizing that sometimes, taking action is necessary, even when it seems daunting or tedious. By approaching our tasks with a sense of purpose and dedication, we can complete them efficiently and without unnecessary stress.\n\nOn the other hand, \"inaction in action\" refers to performing our duties with a sense of detachment and selflessness. This means that we should not be attached to the results or outcomes of our actions, but rather, focus on doing our best and leaving the rest to fate. By approaching our tasks in this way, we can avoid getting caught up in the cycle of karma and its reactions. For example, a business owner might work hard to grow their company, but if they are not attached to the outcome, they will not be affected by any setbacks or failures. This type of detachment allows us to act with clarity and focus, without being weighed down by expectations or fears.\n\nIn conclusion, true wisdom in today's world lies in understanding these concepts of \"action in inaction\" and \"inaction in action.\" By recognizing the importance of taking action when necessary and approaching our tasks with detachment, we can navigate the modern world with clarity, focus, and a sense of purpose.", "personal": "In today's world, \"action in inaction\" refers to finding a way to complete necessary tasks without feeling overwhelmed or stressed by them.

It is the state of the mind that determines what is inaction and action. The minds of enlightened persons are absorbed in God. Being fully satisfied in devotional union with him, they look upon God as their only refuge and do not depend upon external supports. In this state of mind, all their actions are termed as akarm, or inactions..\nThere is a beautiful story in the Puranas to illustrate this point. The gop\u012bs (cowherd women) of Vrindavan once kept a fast. The ceremony of breaking the fast required them to feed a sage. Shree Krishna advised them to feed Sage Durvasa, the elevated ascetic, who lived on the other side of River Yamuna. The gop\u012bs prepared a delicious feast and started off, but found the river was very turbulent that day, and no boatman was willing to ferry them across..\nThe gop\u012bs asked Shree Krishna for a solution. He said, \u201cTell River Yamuna that if Shree Krishna is an akha\u1e47\u1e0d brahmachar\u012b (perfectly celibate since birth), it should give them way.\u201d The gop\u012bs started laughing, because they felt that Shree Krishna used to dote upon them, and so there was no question of his being an akha\u1e47\u1e0d brahmachar\u012b. Nevertheless, when they requested River Yamuna in that manner, the river gave them way and a bridge of flowers manifested for their passage across..\nThe gop\u012bs were astonished. They went across to the \u0101\u015bhram of Sage Durvasa. They requested him to accept the delicious meal they had brought for him. Being an ascetic, he ate only a small portion, which disappointed the gop\u012bs. So, Durvasa decided to fulfill their expectations, and using his mystic powers, he ate everything they had brought. The gop\u012bs were amazed to see him eat so much, but were very pleased that he had done justice to their cooking..\nThe gop\u012bs now asked Durvasa for help to cross the Yamuna and return to the other side. He replied, \u201cTell River Yamuna that if Durvasa has not eaten anything today except doob (a kind of grass which was the only thing Durvasa used to eat), the river should give way.\u201d The gop\u012bs again started laughing, for they had seen him eat such an extravagant meal. Yet to their utmost surprise, when they beseeched River Yamuna in that manner, the river again gave them way..\nThe gop\u012bs asked Shree Krishna the secret behind what had happened. He explained that while God and the Saints appear to engage in material activities externally, internally they are always transcendentally situated. Thus, even while doing all kinds of actions, they are still considered to be non-doers. Although interacting with the gop\u012bs externally, Shree Krishna was an akha\u1e47\u1e0d brahmachar\u012b internally. And though Durvasa ate the delectable meal offered by the gop\u012bs, internally his mind only tasted the doob grass. Both these were illustrations of inaction in action..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "Verse 4.20 explains that individuals who have renounced attachment to the fruits of their actions and are content with what they have, are not dependent on external things even while engaging in activities. This state is achieved when one's mind is absorbed in God and finds complete satisfaction in devotional union with Him. Such people do not rely on external supports as they consider God as their only refuge. In this state of mind, all their actions are considered to be inaction or akarm because the focus is on the internal state of mind rather than the external appearance of the action.\n\nThis concept can be applied in the modern world by understanding that true success and fulfillment come from within, not from external achievements or possessions. When one's mind is focused on serving God or a higher purpose, actions become selfless and devoid of attachment to their outcomes. This detachment leads to contentment and inner peace, which are not dependent on external circumstances. In this state, individuals can still engage in activities but do so without any expectations or desires for personal gain. They remain focused on the internal state of mind and find satisfaction in serving others and contributing to society.\n\nThe story of the gopis and Durvasa illustrates this concept beautifully. Despite their external actions, Shree Krishna and Durvasa were both considered non-doers as their minds were transcendentally situated. They remained focused on their internal state of mind and found contentment in devotion to God. This detachment allowed them to perform actions without any attachment or desire for personal gain, making all their actions appear like inaction or akarm. By understanding this concept, individuals can find true success, fulfillment, and inner peace in the modern world by focusing on serving others and contributing to society from a place of detachment and devotion to a higher purpose.", "startup": "The verse \"Such people, having given up attachment to the fruits of their actions, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all\" (Bhagavad Gita 4.20) can be explained in the context of the modern world as follows:\n\nIn today's fast-paced and result-oriented society, people often get attached to the outcomes or fruits of their actions. They strive hard to achieve success, recognition, and material gains, which leads to a constant craving for more. This attachment to external things can lead to dissatisfaction, as they keep chasing after something that is always out of reach.\n\nHowever, there are people who have transcended this attachment and find satisfaction in their actions themselves. They do not seek any external reward or recognition but instead perform their duties selflessly and with a pure heart. These individuals are not dependent on external things as they derive inner peace and contentment from their actions.\n\nThe concept of \"akarm\" or inaction in action can be understood by looking at the example given in the Puranas. The gopis, who were cowherd women in Vrindavan, once kept a fast and prepared a feast to feed a sage. They faced difficulties in crossing the river Yamuna, but Shree Krishna advised them to ask the river to give way if He was an akha\u1e47\u1e0d brahmachar\u012b (perfectly celibate since birth). The gopis laughed as they knew that Shree Krishna had a special relationship with them. However, when they asked River Yamuna in this manner, it gave way, and a bridge of flowers manifested for their passage across.\n\nSimilarly, Durvasa, an elevated ascetic, ate the delicious meal offered by the gopis but internally only tasted doob grass. When the gopis asked him to help them cross the river Yamuna, he advised them to ask the river to give way if he had not eaten anything except doob grass that day. The gopis laughed as they saw Durvasa eating a lot earlier. However, when they beseeched River Yamuna in this manner, it gave way again.\n\nThese examples illustrate how people who are enlightened and have transcended attachment to external things can perform actions without any expectation of reward or recognition. They find satisfaction in their actions themselves and do not depend on external things for happiness. In the modern world, this concept can be applied to startups as well. Founders who are focused on their mission and values rather than external rewards or recognition can create successful and sustainable businesses that have a positive impact on society.", "personal": "In today's world, the concept of \"inaction in action\" is particularly relevant in our personal relationships. It refers to being fully present and engaged in our interactions with others, while also remaining detached from the outcome or expectations that may arise. This can be challenging in a society that often values productivity and results above all else.\n\nThe verse from Bhagavad Gita, \"Such people, having given up attachment to the fruits of their actions, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all,\" speaks to this idea of being fully present and engaged without attachment or expectation. It's about approaching our relationships with a sense of mindfulness and detachment, rather than being driven by the need for validation or recognition.\n\nIn modern terms, we might call this \"being present\" or \"mindful listening.\" It involves giving our full attention to the person in front of us, without judgment or distraction. It's about truly hearing what they have to say and responding with empathy and understanding. This kind of presence can be transformative in our relationships, as it allows us to connect more deeply with others and build stronger, more meaningful connections.\n\nAnother way to think about this concept is through the idea of \"service\" or \"seva.\" In many Eastern spiritual traditions, seva refers to selfless service performed without attachment to the outcome. It's about doing something for someone else simply because it needs to be done, rather than with the expectation of receiving anything in return. This kind of service can be incredibly powerful in our relationships, as it allows us to give freely and generously, without any strings attached.\n\nIn practical terms, this might look like listening deeply to a friend who is going through a difficult time, without offering advice or trying to \"fix\" the situation. It's about being fully present with them, holding space for their experience, and supporting them in whatever way they need. Or it might look like performing a small act of kindness for someone else, without any expectation of receiving anything in return.\n\nIn both cases, the key is to approach our relationships with a sense of mindfulness and detachment, rather than being driven by the need for validation or recognition. By doing so, we can cultivate deeper, more meaningful connections with others, and contribute to a more compassionate and connected world.", "student": "In today's world, the concept of \"inaction in action\" as described in Bhagavad Gita's verse 4.20 is relevant because it highlights the importance of having a pure and selfless intention behind our actions rather than being attached to their outcomes. When we let go of our desires for personal gain or recognition, we become truly satisfied and independent from external factors. This state of mind allows us to engage in activities without any expectation of reward, as we understand that true fulfillment comes from within.\n\nFor example, a volunteer who serves others selflessly is considered an \"akarmi\" or non-doer because their actions are not motivated by any personal gain but rather by compassion and service to humanity. Similarly, a businessperson who runs their company with integrity and fairness, without any greed for profits, can also be considered an \"akarmi\" as their actions are driven by values and principles rather than selfish motives.\n\nIn the modern world, where materialism and competition have become dominant values, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of success and recognition. However, Bhagavad Gita teaches us that true happiness and fulfillment come from within, and that by letting go of our attachment to external outcomes, we can find inner peace and contentment.\n\nIn the story of the gopis and Durvasa, we see how the state of mind determines what is considered \"inaction in action.\" Both Shree Krishna and Durvasa appeared to be engaged in material activities externally, but internally they were transcendentally situated and free from attachment.

The key lies in being content with whatever gains come our way naturally and without any envy. This means letting go of the need for constant validation or recognition, and instead focusing on doing our duty to the best of our abilities.\n\nWhen we perform actions without attachment to their outcomes, we become free from the dualities that arise from them. We learn to accept both positive and negative results as the will of God and move forward with equanimity.

While the traditional practice of sacrificing animals may not be widely followed, the idea of offering something valuable for a greater cause can still apply. The verse 4.24 speaks about how those who are fully absorbed in God-consciousness see everything as an offering to God. This means that they view all actions and objects as a way to connect with the divine.\n\nIn the context of modern life, this can translate into seeing one's work or career as a form of service to God. Just as a traditional sacrifice involves offering something valuable to the fire, one can offer their skills, time, and energy towards their work with devotion and dedication. The objects used in the work, such as tools or resources, can also be seen as an offering to God.\n\nThe concept of seeing everything as God is not about blindly accepting everything as divine, but rather recognizing the underlying unity and interconnectedness of all things. This perspective can lead to a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment in one's work, as well as a greater appreciation for the value and potential of all objects and actions.\n\nIn summary, the verse 4.24 encourages us to view our lives as a form of sacrifice or offering to God, and to approach everything we do with a sense of devotion and reverence. This can help us cultivate a deeper spiritual connection and find greater meaning and fulfillment in our work and daily activities.", "startup": "In modern terms, this verse highlights the concept of monism, which suggests that everything in the universe is ultimately one and the same. In the context of spirituality and self-realization, this means that when we fully immerse ourselves in God-consciousness or the awareness of our true divine nature, we begin to see the world around us as a manifestation of the divine. This realization leads to a deep sense of unity and oneness with all things, including the objects, people, and actions involved in any kind of sacrifice or offering. As Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explained, the soul is an energy of God, just like the sun's rays are a part of the sun itself. This realization helps us to transcend the duality of the material world and perceive everything as non-different from the divine. It leads to a state of advanced spirituality where we can easily attain God by viewing everything as a manifestation of the divine. In the modern world, this concept can be applied in various aspects of life, including work, relationships, and daily activities, as it helps us to cultivate a deeper sense of unity, compassion, and service towards all beings.", "personal": "In modern times, this verse can be interpreted as a reminder that everything in the world is ultimately connected to God, and those who fully embrace this realization will easily attain Him. This concept of seeing everything as a manifestation of God is known as Advaita Vedanta, which teaches that the individual soul (jiva) and the universal soul (Brahman) are not separate entities but rather two aspects of the same divine reality.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that our actions, thoughts, and relationships with others should be infused with a sense of divinity and unity. We should strive to offer everything we do as an act of worship, recognizing that it is all part of the divine play (lila) of God. This includes our work, our interactions with others, and even the most mundane tasks like cooking or cleaning.\n\nBy viewing everything in this way, we can cultivate a sense of detachment from material desires and attachments, which will lead us closer to God. In essence, we become an offering to God through our actions, just as the objects and instruments used in sacrifice are offered to the divine fire. This realization brings about a profound shift in consciousness, allowing us to experience the world as a sacred and interconnected whole.\n\nIn summary, this verse encourages us to see the world through the lens of Advaita Vedanta, recognizing that everything is an expression of God's infinite power and presence. By embracing this perspective, we can live our lives as a continuous offering to the divine, leading us towards spiritual fulfillment and union with God.", "student": "In today's modern world, the concept of sacrifice as described in Bhagavad Gita's verse 4.24 can be interpreted as offering oneself completely to God-consciousness.

When we are fully absorbed in God-consciousness, we see that the objects of the world, including ourselves, are made of Maya or the material energy of God. We can understand that energy is both one with its energetic and different from it, just like how light is a part of fire but also distinct from it.\n\nThe soul too is an energy of God, called j\u012bva \u015bhakti, which is simultaneously one with and different from the divine.

This is called \u0101tm\u0101hut\u012b or self-surrender. It is a process of surrendering oneself completely to God and is performed by those who have a deeper understanding of spirituality.\n\nIn today's modern world, we can relate this concept to our personal and professional lives. The first type of sacrifice can be seen in people who prioritize material gain over spiritual growth. They offer their time, energy, and resources to achieve success and recognition in their careers or businesses, with the expectation of receiving material rewards in return.\n\nOn the other hand, those who practice self-surrender offer themselves completely to their work or mission, without any expectations of personal gain. They view their work as a service to God and society, rather than just a means to an end. This type of sacrifice requires a deep understanding of spirituality and a strong commitment to one's values and principles.\n\nIn the context of the corporate world, self-surrender can be seen in leaders who prioritize the growth and success of their organization over their personal ambitions. They view their role as a service to their team members, stakeholders, and customers, rather than just a means to advance their own careers. This type of leadership inspires trust, loyalty, and respect from others and leads to long-term success for the organization.\n\nIn summary, verse 4.25 in the Bhagavad Gita teaches us that there are different types of sacrifices we can offer in life, depending on our level of spiritual understanding.

In this second type of yaj\u00f1a, the senses are made to behold the glory of the Creator that manifests in every atom of his creation. The senses no longer remain as instruments for material enjoyment; rather they are sublimated to perceive God in everything. In verse 7.8, Shree Krishna says: raso \u2018ham apsu kaunteya \u201cArjun, know me to be the taste in water.\u201d Accordingly, bhakti yogis practice to behold God through all their senses, in everything they see, hear, taste, feel, and smell. This yaj\u00f1a of devotion is simpler than the path of ha\u1e6dha yog; it is joyous to perform, and involves a smaller risk of downfall from the path.

The mind is often seen as a wild horse that needs to be tamed through consistent practice and detachment from external distractions. This can be achieved through various techniques such as meditation, yoga, or mindfulness practices. By regularly dedicating time to these practices, one can learn to observe their thoughts without judgment and cultivate a sense of inner calmness and clarity.

This surrendering attitude towards God is like a powerful fire that burns away all our karmas in this very lifetime, freeing us from material bondage.

Not all spiritual truths are immediately perceptible; some of them can only be experienced after having attained sufficient elevation on the path. If we only accept what we can presently verify or comprehend, we will be bereft of the higher spiritual secrets. Faith helps us accept what we cannot understand at present. Jagadguru Shankaracharya has defined faith as follows:.\nguru ved\u0101nta v\u0101kye\u1e63hu d\u1e5bi\u1e0dho vi\u015bhv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhraddh\u0101 [v37].\n\u201cFaith means firm confidence in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\u201d When such faith is placed upon a wrong personality, it can lead to disastrous consequences. But when it is placed on the true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare..\nHowever, blind faith is not a desirable thing. Before placing it on any Guru, we must use our intellect to confirm that the Guru has realized the Absolute Truth, and he is teaching it in accordance with the eternal Vedic scriptures. Once this is confirmed, then we should strive to deepen our faith in such a Guru, and surrender to God under his guidance. The Shvetashvatar Upani\u1e63had states:.\nyasya deve par\u0101 bhaktir\u00a0yath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hyarth\u0101\u1e25 prak\u0101\u015bhante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25(6.23)[v38].\n\u201cThe imports of all the Vedic knowledge is revealed within the hearts of those who engage with unflinching faith in devotion toward Guru and God.\u201d.\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "Verse 4.39, as explained by Shree Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, highlights the importance of deep faith and self-control in attaining divine knowledge that leads to eternal peace. In today's world, this verse can be interpreted in the context of personal and professional growth.\n\nFirstly, let us understand what is meant by \"deep faith.\" It is not blind belief or acceptance without questioning. Rather, it is a strong conviction based on logical reasoning and evidence. This type of faith helps us to accept and believe in things that we cannot immediately perceive or comprehend. For instance, when we start a new job, we may not have complete clarity about the company's culture, values, or work processes. However, if we trust our employer's vision and mission, we can develop deep faith in their leadership and guidance, which will help us to adapt and succeed in our role.\n\nSecondly, self-control is essential for attaining divine knowledge. In the modern world, where distractions are abundant, it can be challenging to focus on our goals and objectives. However, by practicing self-discipline and controlling our mind and senses, we can enhance our concentration and mental clarity. This will enable us to absorb and retain new information more effectively, leading to a deeper understanding of the concepts and principles that we are learning.\n\nIn summary, verse 4.39 emphasizes the importance of faith and self-control in achieving spiritual growth and professional success.

It requires a deep understanding that success is not just about making profits but also about creating value for society and contributing to a greater cause.\n\nFaith, however, should not be blind or unquestioning.

If, however, she is besieged with doubts and wants to subject every food item to a chemical test first, how will she ever enjoy and finish her meal? Similarly, a man goes to barber shop to get a shave, and sits on the chair while the barber moves the sharp edge of his knife over his throat. Now, if the man doubts the barber and suspects his having the intention of murder, he will not be able to sit still for the barber to be able to shave him.

Karm yogis are individuals who carry out their professional duties without any attachment or aversion to the outcome. They view both positive and negative results as the grace of God and remain neutral in their approach.\n\nIn the corporate world, this means that karm yogis strive for excellence in their work but do not become overly attached to the outcomes. They understand that success is not always guaranteed and accept failures with equanimity. This detachment allows them to learn from their mistakes and move forward without being bogged down by negative emotions.\n\nMoreover, karm yogis view their professional duties as a form of service to God, rather than just a means to an end. They approach their work with devotion and strive to do it to the best of their abilities. This attitude helps them remain focused on their goals while also being mindful of the impact their actions have on others.\n\nIn essence, karm yogis in the corporate world are individuals who understand that success is not just about achieving personal goals but also about contributing positively to society and the organization they work for.

However, the teachings of Bhagvad Gita provide us with valuable insights that we can apply in our modern context. One such verse is 5.3, which speaks about karm yogis and their state of renunciation.\n\nKarm yogis are individuals who continue to perform their worldly duties while simultaneously practicing detachment. They do not crave for any material gains or fear losing them. Instead, they accept both positive and negative outcomes with equanimity, recognizing that everything is a result of God's grace. This state of mind helps them remain focused on their goals without getting swayed by external circumstances.\n\nIn the context of modern life, this teaching can be applied in various ways. For instance, entrepreneurs who practice karm yoga are less likely to get bogged down by failures or setbacks as they understand that everything happens for a reason and is ultimately for their spiritual growth. They remain steadfast in their work, knowing that it is their duty and responsibility towards society.\n\nAnother example can be seen in the context of customer service. Karm yogis treat all customers equally, whether they are happy or unhappy with the product or service provided. They do not get swayed by negative feedback or complaints as they understand that it is an opportunity for them to learn and improve. This approach helps build a loyal customer base as people appreciate being treated with respect and kindness, regardless of their situation.\n\nIn essence, karm yogis are individuals who lead a simple and content life, free from material desires and attachments.

They do not desire or hate anything, but rather accept both positive and negative outcomes with a sense of equanimity, recognizing them as the grace of God. This approach allows karm yogis to avoid getting caught up in attachment or aversion, which can hinder spiritual progress.\n\nIn today's world, this principle can be applied by practicing mindfulness and cultivating a sense of detachment from material possessions and outcomes. For example, instead of becoming attached to the outcome of a project at work, a karm yogi would focus on doing their best and leaving the rest to God. Similarly, instead of getting caught up in negative emotions like anger or jealousy, they would try to maintain a sense of equanimity and detachment, recognizing that these emotions are temporary and fleeting.\n\nThe story of the wooden deity is a powerful illustration of this principle. Just as the wood had to endure pain and discomfort in order to be transformed into a beautiful deity, we too must be willing to tolerate some level of pain and discomfort in order to grow spiritually. This may mean facing difficult situations at work or in our personal lives with equanimity and detachment, recognizing that these experiences are part of the divine plan for our spiritual growth.\n\nIn summary, by practicing karm yoga in today's world, we can maintain a sense of detachment and equanimity while still fulfilling our worldly duties.

Just as the wood was transformed into something beautiful through the process of being shaped by the sculptor's tools, our hearts too can be refined and purified through the experiences we encounter in life. By accepting both happiness and distress with equanimity, we allow ourselves to grow and evolve spiritually.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of karm yoga is a timeless teaching that continues to hold relevance in today's world. It encourages individuals to lead regular lives while practicing detachment internally, view both positive and negative outcomes as the grace of God, and cultivate inner peace and contentment.

Phalgu vair\u0101gya is where people view the world as burdensome, and renounce it with a desire to escape from responsibilities and difficulties. Such an attitude is escapist and unstable. The renunciation of such individuals is motivated by the desire to avoid hardships. When they encounter difficulties on their spiritual path, they become detached from it and wish to return to worldly life.\n\nYukt vair\u0101gya, on the other hand, is where people see the entire world as an expression of God's energy. They do not consider what they possess as their own but rather view it as a means to serve God. This type of renunciation is stable and unwavering in the face of difficulties.\n\nKarm yogis, while performing their daily duties externally, develop an internal state of yukt vair\u0101gya or stable renunciation. They perceive themselves as servants and view God as the enjoyer. As a result, they become fixed in the consciousness of serving Him with pleasure.

However, those who have a deep understanding of these concepts realize that by applying ourselves to either path, we can achieve the benefits of both.\n\nIn this verse, Krishna uses the term s\u0101nkhya to refer to karm sany\u0101s, which is the renunciation of actions with the cultivation of knowledge. It's essential to understand that there are two types of renunciation: phalgu vair\u0101gya and yukt vair\u0101gya. Phalgu vair\u0101gya is where people view the world as burdensome and renounce it out of a desire to escape responsibilities and hardships. This type of renunciation is unstable because it's motivated by escapism. When such individuals encounter difficulties on their spiritual path, they become disheartened and want to return to worldly life.\n\nYukt vair\u0101gya, on the other hand, is where people see the entire world as an expression of God's energy. They don't consider what they possess as belonging to them but instead view it as a means to serve God. This type of renunciation is stable and not deterred by difficulties because it's motivated by selfless service.\n\nKarm yogis, while performing their daily duties externally, develop the sentiment of yukt vair\u0101gya or stable renunciation. They view themselves as servants and God as the enjoyer, which fixes them in the consciousness of doing everything for His pleasure. Thus, their internal state becomes similar to that of karm sany\u0101s\u012bs who are completely absorbed in divine consciousness. Externally, they may appear worldly, but internally, they're no less than sany\u0101s\u012bs.\n\nThe Puranas and Itih\u0101sas provide examples of great kings in Indian history who discharged their duties diligently while living in royal opulence but were mentally absorbed in God-consciousness. Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, Vibheeshan, Yudhishthir, etc., were all such exemplary karm yogis.

The distinction between these paths lies in one's attitude towards actions. Those who seek to escape from the world due to its difficulties are practicing phalgu vair\u0101gya (false renunciation), which is unstable and temporary. However, those who view everything as a manifestation of God and use it for His service, without attachment or desire for personal gain, are practicing yukt vair\u0101gya (true renunciation). Karma yogis, while performing their daily duties, cultivate this attitude of stable renunciation. They see themselves as servants of God and act with the intention to please Him.

While some may believe that completely withdrawing from materialistic pursuits is the path to true renunciation, Shree Krishna's teachings in verse 5.6 suggest otherwise.\n\nAccording to this verse, perfect renunciation (karm sany\u0101s) is challenging to achieve without performing one's duties selflessly and with devotion (karm yog). The sage who has mastered karm yog quickly attains the Supreme. This means that while it may be tempting to abandon worldly responsibilities in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment, true renunciation comes from within as a natural consequence of performing one's duties with devotion and selflessness.\n\nThe example given in this verse is that of a yogi who has spent years in the mountains practicing austerities but loses his composure when faced with the hustle and bustle of city life. This highlights the fact that true renunciation is tested in the world, not in isolation. It requires the ability to rise above anger, greed, and desire while performing one's duties selflessly.\n\nIn today's corporate world, this concept can be applied by individuals who strive to balance their professional responsibilities with spiritual values. Instead of abandoning work altogether, they can dedicate their service unselfishly to a higher purpose, such as serving society or contributing to the company's mission. This will not only purify their minds but also lead to true renunciation from within.\n\nIn summary, verse 5.6 teaches us that while it may be challenging to attain perfect renunciation without performing duties, selfless service is the path to achieve it. It requires the ability to rise above worldly desires and perform one's duties with devotion, which will lead to true renunciation from within. This concept is highly relevant in today's corporate world, where individuals can balance their professional responsibilities with spiritual values by dedicating their service unselfishly to a higher purpose.", "startup": "In today's fast-paced and competitive world, the concept of renunciation may seem outdated or impractical. However, the teachings of Bhagavad Gita still hold relevance in our modern context, especially when it comes to achieving success in the startup world. The verse 5.6 from the Gita talks about the importance of performing work in devotion (karm yog) for attaining true renunciation (karm sany\u0101s).\n\nIn a startup, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of success and material gains. However, if our actions are not guided by a higher purpose or sense of duty towards something greater than ourselves, then we may end up losing sight of what truly matters. The true test of renunciation comes when we face challenges and setbacks in our work. It's easy to give in to anger, greed, and desire when things don't go as planned, but this is precisely where we need to practice karm yog - performing our duties with detachment and selflessness.\n\nThe story of the sadhu who lost his renunciation after returning to the city serves as a cautionary tale for all of us. Our actions and decisions should be guided by a sense of duty towards our work, but we must also learn to rise above attachment and desire. This is not an easy task, and it requires consistent practice and self-reflection.\n\nThe Lord's instruction to Arjuna in the Gita - \"Continue to fight, but make one change. At first, you came to this battleground on the presumption of saving a kingdom. Now, instead, simply dedicate your service unselfishly to God\" - is still relevant today. In our work, we must learn to dedicate ourselves selflessly and without attachment to the outcome. This will help us purify our minds and achieve true renunciation from within.\n\nThe verse also highlights the importance of using our natural inclinations and talents in the service of God. Just as a warrior like Arjuna should continue to fight, but with a change in his perspective, we too should use our skills and abilities for a higher purpose. This will not only help us achieve success in our work but also lead to personal growth and fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, the teachings of Bhagavad Gita, particularly the verse 5.6, offer valuable insights into achieving success and fulfillment in today's world. By practicing karm yog and dedicating ourselves selflessly to our work, we can purify our minds, overcome attachment and desire, and achieve true renunciation from within. This will not only help us succeed in our work but also lead to personal growth and fulfillment.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita teaches us that true renunciation is not just about giving up material possessions or withdrawing from society, but rather about performing our duties with selflessness and devotion. It highlights the importance of practicing karma yoga, which involves doing one's work without attachment to the outcome or desire for rewards. This helps in purifying the mind and achieving true renunciation from within. The verse also emphasizes that true renunciation is not easy to attain without practicing karma yoga because it requires detachment from desires and attachments, which can only be achieved through selfless action. In modern times, this lesson applies to our personal and professional lives as we strive to balance our duties with detachment and selflessness. It encourages us to approach our work with a sense of service to others and the divine, rather than just for personal gain or recognition. By doing so, we can achieve true renunciation and inner peace, even while living in the world.", "student": "In today's world, the concept of renunciation (sany\u0101s) can be interpreted as letting go of material desires and attachments. However, it is not an easy feat to achieve without first practicing selfless service or karma yoga. In fact, Shree Krishna emphasizes that true renunciation comes naturally from within after one has dedicated their actions to God and purified their mind through karma yoga.\n\nIn the modern context, this means that we should strive to perform our duties in the world with a selfless attitude, without being attached to the outcomes or rewards. This can be challenging as we are often driven by desires and expectations, but it is essential for spiritual growth and true renunciation. By practicing karma yoga, we learn to rise above anger, greed, and desire, and instead focus on serving others and fulfilling our duties with a pure heart.\n\nThe test of our renunciation comes when we are faced with situations that challenge us, such as dealing with difficult people or unexpected setbacks. It is in these moments that we must remain calm, detached, and focused on our spiritual path. Just as the sadhu in the example above learned the hard way, it is easy to lose our renunciation in the hustle and bustle of daily life.

The verse from Bhagavad Gita that we're discussing here highlights the difference between those who are bound by their actions and those who are released from material bondage.\n\nThe key to understanding this verse lies in the words \"offering the results of all activities to God\" and \"attain everlasting peace.\" When we perform any action, whether it's work-related or personal, there's always an expected outcome or result. It could be a promotion at work, a successful project, or simply completing a task. The problem arises when we become attached to these results and start craving for them. This attachment leads us down a path of materialism and selfishness, which ultimately binds us to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nOn the other hand, those who are unattached and offer the results of their actions to God, attain everlasting peace. By doing so, they're not motivated by any external reward or recognition. Instead, their sole motivation is self-purification and spiritual growth. This detachment from material gains allows them to break free from the cycle of karma and attain liberation.\n\nIn today's startup world, this concept can be applied in various ways. For instance, if a founder starts a company with the sole intention of making profits and becoming rich, they're likely to become attached to the outcomes and ultimately get bound by materialism. However, if the same founder starts the company with the aim of solving a problem or creating value for society, they're more likely to remain detached from material gains and attain everlasting peace.\n\nIn conclusion, the verse from Bhagavad Gita highlights the importance of detachment and self-purification in achieving spiritual growth and breaking free from the cycle of karma.

However, just as in the verse, neither the organization nor its leaders are responsible for our work outcomes. The success or failure of a project is determined by various external factors and circumstances beyond their control, such as market conditions, competition, and customer demands.\n\nSimilarly, we often take pride in being the \"doers\" of our projects, but this sense of ownership can lead to arrogance and ignorance about our limitations.

This realization can help us approach our work with humility and a better understanding of its true nature.\n\nIn summary, just as God is not responsible for our actions or their outcomes, neither is our company's leadership.

Instead, we need to understand that external factors beyond our control, such as market conditions, competition, and luck, also play a crucial role in determining the outcome of our actions.\n\nIn other words, we should avoid getting too attached to the results of our efforts and instead focus on performing our duties with sincerity and detachment. This will help us to remain calm and composed during both successes and failures, as we understand that they are not entirely within our control.\n\nFurthermore, this verse also highlights the importance of recognizing the limitations of our own abilities and acknowledging that our success is not solely due to our efforts but also because of the support and resources provided by others. This humility will enable us to collaborate better with our teams, partners, and stakeholders, leading to a more sustainable and successful venture in the long run.\n\nIn summary, this verse from Bhagavad Gita teaches us that as entrepreneurs, we should avoid taking complete ownership of the outcomes of our actions and instead focus on performing our duties with sincerity and detachment while recognizing the role of external factors beyond our control.

Rather, we should take responsibility for our actions and strive to overcome our ignorance through self-reflection and spiritual practices. By doing so, we can cultivate a deeper understanding of our true nature as non-doers and learn to act in alignment with our higher values and principles.\n\nIn modern society, this verse also highlights the importance of recognizing that external factors and circumstances do not necessarily determine our actions or outcomes. While these factors may influence us, ultimately we have the power to choose how to respond and what actions to take. This can be a powerful reminder in times of adversity or challenge, as it encourages us to focus on our own inner resources and strengths rather than external circumstances beyond our control.\n\nIn personal relationships, this verse can also help us to cultivate greater compassion and understanding towards others. By recognizing that their actions are not necessarily a reflection of who they are as individuals, but rather the result of their own ignorance and material nature, we can learn to approach them with more empathy and forgiveness. This can lead to deeper connections and more harmonious relationships based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nOverall, this verse serves as a powerful reminder that our sense of control over our actions is not inherently given to us by external factors or higher powers, but rather arises from within ourselves due to ignorance.

The teachings of Bhagavad Gita offer practical insights that can help us navigate this complex landscape. One such verse is 5.27-28, which describes a yogic practice that can lead to liberation from material desires and bring about inner freedom.\n\nIn modern terms, the first step in this process involves shutting out external distractions and focusing our minds on a specific point between the eyebrows. This technique, known as Trataka or Dhyaan, involves gazing steadily at a single object, such as a candle flame or a picture of a deity, until it becomes etched in our consciousness. By doing so, we can train our minds to become more focused and less reactive to external stimuli.\n\nThe second step is to regulate our breathing, equalizing the flow of air in and out of our nostrils. This practice, known as Pranayama, helps us to calm our nervous system and bring about a state of deep relaxation. By controlling our breath, we can also learn to control our thoughts and emotions, which is essential for achieving inner peace and clarity.\n\nThe third step involves controlling the senses, mind, and intellect through this practice. As we become more aware of our thoughts and emotions, we can learn to detach ourselves from material desires and cultivate a sense of inner freedom. This state of liberation, known as Moksha, is not just about renouncing worldly pleasures but also about realizing our true nature as spiritual beings.\n\nIn the corporate world, these practices can help us to become more focused, productive, and resilient in the face of challenges.

However, some of these practitioners may become too focused on renunciation and lose interest in the path of devotion, which involves meditating on the divine attributes of God.\n\nIn this verse from Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna describes a different path for ascetics. He explains that they can control their thoughts by focusing their gaze between their eyebrows or the tip of their nose, with half-open eyes. This helps them avoid falling asleep or getting distracted by external objects. They also harmonize their breath to achieve yogic trance and gain control over their senses, mind, and intellect.\n\nHowever, this path alone does not lead to true liberation. It only provides knowledge of the self (atma jnana) but not of God (brahma jnana). Therefore, ascetics must also cultivate devotion to God through meditation on His names, forms, pastimes, and abodes.\n\nIn the modern world, this verse can inspire us to find a balance between spiritual practices and devotion to God. It reminds us that true liberation comes not just from controlling our senses and mind but also from connecting with the divine. By following this path, we can achieve inner peace and fulfillment in today's busy and materialistic world.", "personal": "In today's world, this verse from Bhagavad Gita can be interpreted as a guidance for achieving inner peace and mental clarity amidst the distractions of modern life.

This practice is known as Trataka in yoga, and it helps to strengthen our concentration and focus.\n\nIn addition to controlling our sight, we can also regulate our breath by equalizing the flow of air through our nostrils. This technique, called Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, can help us to calm our mind and reduce stress levels. By combining these practices with a commitment to renunciation and detachment from material desires, we can cultivate a sense of inner freedom and liberation from the distractions of the world around us.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these ascetic practices are beneficial for achieving mental clarity and inner peace, they should not be mistaken as a substitute for devotion to God. True liberation comes only through surrendering ourselves to the divine and cultivating a deep connection with the Divine through prayer, meditation, and service.

However, Shree Krishna clarifies that true renunciation and yoga go beyond external actions and involve an internal transformation of the mind.\n\nThe verse explains that those who perform their duties without any attachment to the results are the actual renunciants and yogis, not just those who have stopped performing certain rituals or abandoned bodily activities. This concept is known as karma yoga, where one performs actions selflessly and with a sense of service to God. Such individuals may still be living with their families but have attained a state of inner detachment from material desires.\n\nIn today's world, the term \"yoga\" has become popular due to its physical benefits, but true yoga involves the union of the individual consciousness with the divine consciousness. This requires a deep level of mental absorption in God and a detachment from worldly attachments. Therefore, the true yogi is also the true renunciant.\n\nThe verse also highlights that external practices such as fasting or living without clothes do not automatically make someone a renunciant or yogi. These actions should be seen as part of a spiritual path and not as a means to achieve spirituality. The focus should be on developing inner detachment, selfless service, and mental absorption in God.\n\nIn conclusion, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita reminds us that true renunciation and yoga involve an internal transformation of the mind, not just external actions or practices. It encourages us to develop a sense of detachment from material desires, perform our duties selflessly, and focus on developing mental absorption in God. In today's world, where materialism is rampant, this message is more relevant than ever before."}}, "6.2": {"sanskrit": " \u092f\u0902 \u0938\u0902\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0902 \u0924\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0935 |\u0928 \u0939\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0938\u0919\u094d\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u094b \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0928 || 2||.\nya\u1e41 sanny\u0101sam iti pr\u0101hur yoga\u1e41 ta\u1e41 viddhi p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davana hyasannyasta-sa\u1e45kalpo yog\u012b bhavati ka\u015bhchana.\nyam sannyasam iti prahur yogam tam viddhi pandavana hyasannyasta-sankalpo yogi bhavati kashchana.", "english": " What is known as sany\u0101s is non-different from Yog, for none become yogis without renouncing worldly desires.\n                        .\nA sany\u0101s\u012b is one who renounces the pleasures of the mind and senses. But mere renunciation is not the goal, nor is it sufficient to reach the goal. Renunciation means that our running in the wrong direction has stopped. We were searching for happiness in the world, and we understood that there is no happiness in material pleasures, so we stopped running toward the world. But, the destination is not reached just by stopping. The destination of the soul is God-realization. The process of going toward God\u2014taking the mind toward him\u2014is the path of Yog. Those who have incomplete knowledge of the goal of life, look upon renunciation as the highest goal of spirituality. Those who truly understand the goal of life, regard God-realization as the ultimate goal of their spiritual endeavor..\nIn the purport to verse 5.4, it was explained that there are two kinds of renunciation\u2014phalgu vair\u0101gya and yukt vair\u0101gya. Phalgu vair\u0101gya is that where worldly objects are seen as objects of Maya, the material energy, and hence renounced because they are detrimental to spiritual progress. Yukt vair\u0101gya is that where everything is seen as belonging to God, and hence meant to be utilized in his service. In the first kind of renunciation, one would say, \u201cGive up money. Do not touch it. It is a form of Maya, and it impedes the path of spirituality.\u201d In the second kind of renunciation, one would say, \u201cMoney is also a form of the energy of God. Do not waste it or throw it away; utilize whatever you have in your possession for the service of God.\u201d.\nPhalgu vair\u0101gya is unstable, and can easily revert to attachment for the world. The name \u201cPhalgu\u201d comes from a river in the city of Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India. The river Phalgu runs below the surface. From atop, it seems as if there is no water, but if you dig a few feet, you encounter the stream below. Similarly, many persons renounce the world to go and live in monasteries, only to find that in a few years the renunciation has vanished and the mind is again attached to the world. Their detachment was phalgu vair\u0101gya. Finding the world to be troublesome and miserable, they desired to get away from it by taking shelter in monastery. But when they found spiritual life also to be difficult and arduous, they got detached from spirituality as well. Then there are others who establish their loving relationship with God. Motivated by the desire to serve him, they renounce the world to live in a monastery. Their renunciation is yukt vair\u0101gya. They usually continue the journey even if they face difficulties..\nIn the first line of this verse, Shree Krishna states that a real sany\u0101s\u012b (renunciant) is one who is a yogi, i.e. one who is uniting the mind with God in loving service. In the second line, Shree Krishna states that one cannot be a yogi without giving up material desires. If there are material desires in the mind, then it will naturally run toward the world. Since it is the mind that has to be united with God, this is only possible if the mind is free from all material desires. Thus, to be a yogi one has to be a sany\u0101s\u012b from within; and one can only be a sany\u0101s\u012b if one is a yogi..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's world, the concept of renunciation or sannyasa may seem outdated or impractical for many. However, the verse \"What is known as sannyasa is non-different from Yog, for none become yogis without renouncing worldly desires\" still holds relevance in our modern context.\n\nIn simple terms, this verse emphasizes that true spirituality or self-realization cannot be achieved by merely giving up material possessions or running away from the world. It requires a deeper level of understanding and transformation within oneself. The word \"Yog\" here refers to the union of the individual soul with the divine, which is possible only when one has renounced all material desires and attachments.\n\nIn our corporate world, this verse can be interpreted as follows: Success in the workplace cannot be achieved by just giving up one's job or running away from competition. It requires a deeper level of understanding and transformation within oneself. One needs to have a clear vision, focus, and detachment from material gains to become truly successful.\n\nIn today's fast-paced and materialistic society, it may be challenging to renounce worldly desires completely. However, the key is to have a yukt vairagya, which means seeing everything as belonging to God and utilizing it in his service. This approach helps one avoid attachment and attachment-based suffering while still being productive and successful in their work.\n\nIn summary, the verse \"What is known as sannyasa is non-different from Yog, for none become yogis without renouncing worldly desires\" reminds us that true spirituality or success requires a deeper level of understanding and transformation within oneself, which can be achieved by renouncing material desires and seeing everything as belonging to God.", "startup": "In today's world, the verse \"What is known as sany\u0101s is non-different from Yog, for none become yogis without renouncing worldly desires\" can be interpreted as follows:\n\nA true spiritual seeker who has attained the state of sannyasa (renunciation) is not different from a yogi (one who has achieved union with the divine). This is because true renunciation goes beyond just giving up material possessions or worldly pleasures. It involves letting go of all cravings and desires that bind us to the material world, including our attachment to success, power, and prestige.\n\nWithout this inner renunciation, it is impossible to become a yogi. The mind cannot be stilled or focused on the divine if it is constantly pulled in different directions by external stimuli or internal desires. Therefore, true spiritual progress requires both sannyasa and yoga - the former providing the necessary detachment, and the latter helping us cultivate the inner strength and focus required to unite with the divine.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, this verse can have several implications for entrepreneurs and businesspeople:\n\n1. True success in business requires both material wealth and spiritual fulfillment. While it is important to strive for financial gain, it is equally important to let go of excessive attachment to money and power. This will help us maintain a healthy perspective on our work and avoid getting caught up in the rat race.\n\n2. The pursuit of spirituality should not be seen as separate from our professional lives. In fact, true success in business often requires a deep sense of purpose and values, which can only come from within. By cultivating inner renunciation and yoga, we can become more focused, disciplined, and compassionate leaders who are able to create value for all stakeholders.\n\n3. The modern world is characterized by constant distractions and external stimuli that can easily pull us away from our spiritual path. To maintain inner peace and focus, it is essential to cultivate a sense of detachment from these distractions and learn to prioritize what truly matters. This will help us stay centered and focused on our goals, even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty.\n\nIn summary, the verse \"What is known as sany\u0101s is non-different from Yog, for none become yogis without renouncing worldly desires\" serves as a powerful reminder that true spiritual progress requires both inner renunciation and outer action. By cultivating these qualities in our personal and professional lives, we can achieve success and fulfillment that goes beyond mere material gain.", "personal": "In today's world, the concept of renunciation or sannyasa may seem outdated or impractical to some.

It's about letting go of attachments and desires that hinder our spiritual growth and prevent us from realizing our true selves. In other words, it's about learning to live a simple and contented life, free from the constant cravings and comparisons that plague us in our materialistic society.\n\nThe verse suggests that true yoga or union with the divine cannot be achieved without renunciation. This is because our mind is constantly pulled in different directions by worldly desires, making it difficult to focus on spiritual pursuits. By renouncing these desires, we can train our mind to become more focused and disciplined, allowing us to make progress on our spiritual path.\n\nIn the context of modern life, this verse encourages us to reflect on our priorities and values. Are we living a life that is truly fulfilling, or are we chasing after fleeting pleasures and material possessions? Are we willing to let go of certain desires in order to deepen our spiritual practice and connect with the divine?\n\nUltimately, the verse invites us to embrace a more holistic and balanced way of living, one that integrates both material and spiritual pursuits.

Anticipating such a question, Shree Krishna sets the limits for it. When we perform karm yog, it leads to the purification of the mind and the ripening of spiritual knowledge.

The ladder of Yog takes the soul from that level to the stage where the consciousness is absorbed in the divine. The various rungs of the ladder have different names, but Yog is a term common to them all.

In the initial stages of our spiritual journey, we are focused on achieving external goals and outcomes through our actions.

By doing so, we can experience true inner peace and happiness, free from the shackles of material desire.\n\nIn summary, the Bhagavad Gita's teachings on detachment are still highly relevant in today's world, as they offer a path to spiritual growth and freedom from suffering.

Nobody can traverse the path of God-realization for us. Saints and Gurus show us the way, but we have to travel it ourselves.

At any period of time, if the world is devoid of such Saints, then the souls of that period cannot become God-realized. How then can they fulfill the purpose of human life, which is God-realization? Thus, God ensures that God-realized Saints are always present in every era, to guide the sincere seekers and inspire humanity. So, in infinite past lifetimes, many times we must have met God-realized Saints and yet we did not become God-realized. This means that the problem was not lack of proper guidance, but either our reticence in accepting it or working according to it. Thus, we must first accept responsibility for our present level of spirituality, or lack thereof. Only then will we gain the confidence that if we have brought ourselves to our present state, we can also elevate ourselves by our efforts..\nWhen we suffer reversals on the path of spiritual growth, we tend to complain that others have caused havoc to us, and they are our enemies. However, our biggest enemy is our own mind. It is the saboteur that thwarts our aspirations for perfection. Shree Krishna states that, on the one hand, as the greatest benefactor of the soul, the mind has the potential of giving us the most benefit; on the other hand, as our greatest adversary, it also has the potential for causing the maximum harm. A controlled mind can accomplish many beneficial endeavors, whereas an uncontrolled mind can degrade the consciousness with most ignoble thoughts..\nIn order to be able to use it as a friend, it is important to understand the mind\u2019s nature. Our mind operates at four levels:.\nMind: When it creates thoughts, we call it mana, or the mind..\nIntellect: When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi, or intellect..\nChitta: When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta..\nEgo: When it identifies with the bodily identifications and becomes proud of things like wealth, status, beauty, and learning, we call it ahank\u0101r, or ego..\nThese are not four separate entities. They are simply four levels of functioning of the one mind. Hence, we may refer to them all together as the mind, or as the mind-intellect, or as the mind-intellect-ego, or as the mind-intellect-chitta-ego. They all refer to the same thing..\nThe use of the word ego here is different from its connotation in Freudian psychology. Sigmund Freud (1856 \u2013 1939), an Austrian neurologist, proposed the first theory of psychology regarding how the mind works. According to him, the ego is the \u201creal self\u201d that bridges the gap between our untamed desires (Id) and the value system that is learnt during childhood (Superego)..\nVarious scriptures describe the mind in one of these four ways for the purpose of explaining the concepts presented there. They are all referring to the same internal apparatus within us, which is together called anta\u1e25 kara\u1e47, or the mind. For example:.\nThe Pa\u00f1chada\u015bh\u012b refers to all four together as the mind, and states that it is the cause of material bondage..\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly talks of the mind and the intellect as being two things, and emphasizes the need to surrender both to God..\nThe Yog Dar\u015bhan, while analyzing the different elements of nature, talks of three entities: mind, intellect, and ego..\nShankaracharya, while explaining the apparatus available to the soul, classifies the mind into four\u2014mind, intellect, chitta and ego..\nSo when Shree Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self, he means we must use the higher mind to elevate the lower mind. In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. How this can be done has been explained in detail in verses 2.41 to 2.44 and again in verse 3.43..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, it is easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily tasks and forget about our personal growth and spirituality.

On one hand, the mind has the potential to be a great friend and ally on this path, helping us to think clearly, make wise decisions, and focus our energies on our goals. On the other hand, the mind can also act as an enemy, causing us to doubt ourselves, get distracted by negative thoughts, or become overwhelmed by emotions.\n\nTo use the mind as a friend and avoid degrading ourselves, we must first understand its nature. The mind operates at four levels: mind, intellect, chitta, and ego. By learning to control these different aspects of our mind, we can harness their power for our own benefit.

Illness is not only caused by viruses and bacteria, but also by the negativities we harbor in the mind. If someone accidentally throws a stone at you, it may hurt for a few minutes, but by the next day, you will probably have forgotten about it. However, if someone says something unpleasant, it may continue to agitate your mind for years. This is the immense power of the thoughts.

Thus, those who slide to demoniac levels do so because of their own mind while those who attain sublime heights also do so because of their purified minds. Accordingly, Franklin D.

Our minds become attached to these experiences, leading us to chase after pleasurable sensations and avoid painful ones.

Only one who practices for several hours every day achieves the mastery required to win the Olympics. Practice is essential for spiritual mastery as well. Shree Krishna now explains the process of accomplishing spiritual mastery by recommending the daily practice of meditation. The first point he mentions is the need for a secluded place.

If milk is poured into water, it cannot retain its undiluted identity, for water naturally mixes with it. However, if the milk is kept separate from water and converted into yogurt, and then the yogurt is churned to extract butter, the butter becomes immiscible. It can now challenge the water, \u201cI will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.\u201d Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water. In contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly. However, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God. Once sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, \u201cI will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.\u201d.\nThis instruction for seclusion has been repeated by Shree Krishna in verse 18.52: vivikt sev\u012b laghv\u0101\u015bh\u012b  \u201cLive in a secluded place; control your diet.\u201d There is a beautiful way of practically applying this instruction without disturbing our professional and social works. In our daily schedule, we can allocate some time for s\u0101dhan\u0101, or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances. Shutting ourselves out from the world, we should do s\u0101dhan\u0101 to purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God. If we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities.

During this time, we should focus on purifying our minds through meditation and maintaining a controlled body by practicing yoga or other relaxation techniques.\n\nThe benefits of regular meditation are well-documented, including reduced stress, improved focus, and enhanced emotional stability. By dedicating just one to two hours every day for spiritual practice in isolation, we can carry these positive effects with us throughout the day, even while engaged in worldly activities. This way, we can maintain an elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during our daily s\u0101dhan\u0101, despite being surrounded by the distractions and demands of modern life.\n\nIn summary, Shree Krishna's instruction to reside in seclusion for spiritual practice may seem challenging in today's world, but it is still relevant and achievable through practical applications like daily meditation in a quiet space. By doing so, we can cultivate the mindfulness and focus required for achieving spiritual mastery in our modern lives.", "student": "In today's fast-paced and technology-driven world, it can be challenging to find peace and quiet. However, Shree Krishna's teachings in Bhagvad Gita still hold relevance, and his advice on how to achieve spiritual mastery is just as applicable now as it was thousands of years ago.\n\nOne of the key verses that highlight this process is 6.10, which encourages seekers of Yog to live in seclusion and dedicate themselves fully to meditation. In today's context, this can be interpreted as carving out a specific time and space for spiritual practice, free from distractions and external influences.\n\nThe modern world is full of noise and stimuli that distract the mind and make it difficult to focus on anything for an extended period. By creating a secluded environment, we can train our minds to concentrate on spiritual pursuits and cultivate a deeper connection with God. This could be as simple as finding a quiet corner in your home or office, or seeking out a peaceful retreat in nature.\n\nThe verse also emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind and body during meditation. In today's world, where we are constantly bombarded by information and demands on our time, it can be challenging to quiet the mind and achieve a state of calmness. However, with regular practice, this becomes easier over time.\n\nThe analogy of milk and water is particularly relevant in today's context, as we are constantly exposed to a barrage of sensory inputs that can dilute our focus and make it difficult to maintain a spiritual perspective. By creating a secluded environment for meditation, we can separate ourselves from these distractions and cultivate a stronger connection with God.\n\nIn conclusion, Shree Krishna's teachings on achieving spiritual mastery through daily practice of meditation in a secluded environment are just as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. By carving out time for spiritual practice and creating a peaceful environment, we can train our minds to focus on God and cultivate a deeper connection with the divine."}}, "6.11": {"sanskrit": " \u0936\u0941\u091a\u094c \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0928\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928: |\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0928\u093e\u0924\u093f\u0928\u0940\u091a\u0902 \u091a\u0948\u0932\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0941\u0936\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930\u092e\u094d || 11||.\n\u015bhuchau de\u015bhe prati\u1e63h\u1e6dh\u0101pya sthiram \u0101sanam \u0101tmana\u1e25n\u0101tyuchchhrita\u1e41 n\u0101ti-n\u012bcha\u1e41 chail\u0101jina-ku\u015bhottaram.\nshuchau deshe pratishthapya sthiram asanam atmanahnatyuchchhritam nati-nicham chailajina-kushottaram.", "english": " To practice Yog, one should make an \u0101san (seat) in a sanctified place, by placing Ku\u015bh grass, deer skin, and a cloth, one over the other.

In s\u0101dhan\u0101, there is a tendency to become lazy and doze off to sleep. This happens because the material mind does not initially get as much bliss in contemplation on God as it does while relishing sense objects. This creates the possibility for the mind to become languid when focused on God. Hence, you do not find people dozing off half-way through their meal, but you do see people falling asleep during meditation and the chanting of God\u2019s names. To avoid this, Shree Krishna gives the instruction to sit erect. The Brahma S\u016btra also states three aphorisms regarding the posture for meditation:.\n\u0101s\u012bna\u1e25 sambhav\u0101t  (4.1.7)[v5] \u201cTo do s\u0101dhan\u0101, seat yourself properly.\u201d.\nachalatva\u1e41 ch\u0101pek\u1e63hya (4.1.9)[v6] \u201cEnsure that you sit erect and still.\u201d.\ndhy\u0101n\u0101chcha (4.1.8)[v7] \u201cSeated in this manner, focus the mind in meditation.\u201d.\nThere are a number of meditative \u0101sans described in the Hath Yoga Pradeepika, such as padmasan, ardha padmasan, dhyanveer asan, siddhasan, and sukhasan. We may adopt any \u0101san in which we can comfortably sit, without moving, during the period of the meditation. Maharshi Pata\u00f1jali states:.\nsthira sukham\u0101sanam (Pata\u00f1jali Yog S\u016btra 2.46)[v8].\n\u201cTo practice meditation, sit motionless in any posture that you are comfortable in.\u201d Some people are unable to sit on the floor due to knee problems, etc. They should not feel discouraged, for they can even practice meditation while sitting on a chair, provided they fulfill the condition of sitting motionless and erect..\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna states that the eyes should be made to focus on the tip of the nose, and prevented from wandering. As a variation, the eyes can also be kept closed. Both these techniques will be helpful in blocking out worldly distractions..\nThe external seat and posture do need to be appropriate, but meditation is truly a journey within us. Through meditation, we can reach deep within and cleanse the mind of endless lifetimes of dross. By learning to hold the mind in concentration, we can work upon it to harness its latent potential. The practice of meditation helps organize our personality, awaken our inner consciousness, and expand our self-awareness. The spiritual benefits of meditation are described later, in the purport on verse 6.15. Some of the side benefits are:.\nIt reins the unbridled mind, and harnesses the thought energy to attain difficult goals..\nIt helps maintain mental balance in the midst of adverse circumstances..\nIt aids in the development of a strong resolve that is necessary for success in life..\nIt enables one to eliminate bad sansk\u0101rs and habits, and cultivate good qualities..\nThe best kind of meditation is one where the mind is focused upon God.

They have gained pureness of heart, which allows them to see things as they truly are and not be swayed by external influences or distractions. This purity of heart comes from a deep understanding of one's true nature and the realization that everything is interconnected and part of a larger whole.

The sexual desire facilitates the process of procreation in the animal kingdom, and animals indulge in it primarily for that purpose. In most species, there is a particular mating season; animals do not indulge in sexual activity wantonly. Since humans have greater intellects and the freedom to indulge at will, the activity of procreation is converted into a means of licentious enjoyment.

For one to be considered celibate, all these must be shunned.

There are Zen techniques, Buddhist techniques, Tantric techniques, Taoist techniques, Vedic techniques, and so on. Each of these has many sub-branches. Amongst the followers of Hinduism itself, there are innumerable techniques being practiced. Which of these should we adopt for our personal practice? Shree Krishna makes this riddle easy to solve. He states that the object of meditation should be God himself and God alone..\nThe aim of meditation is not merely to enhance concentration and focus, but also to purify the mind. Meditating on the breath, chakras, void, flame, etc. is helpful in developing focus. However, the purification of the mind is only possible when we fix it upon an all-pure object, which is God himself. Hence, verse 14.26 states that God is beyond the three modes of material nature, and when one fixes the mind upon him, it too rises above the three modes. Thus, meditating upon the pr\u0101\u1e47as may be called transcendental by its practitioners, but true transcendental meditation is upon God alone..\nNow what is the way of fixing the mind upon God? We can make all of God\u2019s divine attributes\u2014names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, associates\u2014the objects of meditation. They are all non-different from God and replete with all his energies. Hence, devotees may meditate upon any of these and get the true benefit of meditating upon God. In the various bhakti traditions in India, the name of God is made the basis of contemplation. Thus, the Ramayan states:.\nbrahma r\u0101m te\u1e45 n\u0101mu ba\u1e5ba, bara d\u0101yaka bara d\u0101ni [v10].\n\u201cGod\u2019s name is bigger than God himself, in terms of its utility to the souls.\u201d Taking the name is a very convenient way of remembering God, since it can be taken anywhere and everywhere\u2014while walking, talking, sitting, eating, etc..\nHowever, for most s\u0101dhaks the name by itself is not sufficiently attractive for enchanting the mind. Due to sansk\u0101rs of endless lifetimes, the mind is naturally drawn to forms. Using the form of God as the basis, meditation becomes natural and easy. This is called r\u016bp dhy\u0101n meditation..\nOnce the mind is focused upon the form of God, we can then further enhance it by contemplating upon the virtues of God\u2014his compassion, his beauty, his knowledge, his love, his benevolence, his grace, and so on. One can then advance in meditation by serving God in the mind. We can visualize ourselves offering foodstuffs to him, worshipping him, singing to him, massaging him, fanning him, bathing him, cooking for him, etc. This is called m\u0101nas\u012b sev\u0101 (serving God in the mind). In this way, we can meditate upon the names, forms, virtues, pastimes, etc. of God. All these become powerful means of fulfilling Shree Krishna\u2019s instruction to Arjun, in this verse, to keep the mind absorbed in him..\nAt the end of the verse, Shree Krishna gives the ultimate benefits of meditation, which are liberation from Maya and the everlasting beatitude of God-realization..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, it can be challenging to find peace and clarity amidst the constant demands and distractions.

So simply engage in spiritual activity, forgetting about the maintenance of the body.\u201d.\nHowever, such a philosophy cannot get one too far. It is true that we are not the body, yet the body is our carrier as long as we live, and we are obliged to take care of it.

The Ramayan states: tanu binu bhajana veda nahi\u1e45 varan\u0101 [v12] \u201cThe Vedas do not recommend that we ignore the body, while engaging in spirituality.\u201d In fact, they instruct us to take good care of our body with the help of material science.

But those who cultivate only spiritual science go to an even darker hell.\u201d Material science is necessary for the maintenance of our body, while spiritual science is necessary for the manifestation of the internal divinity within us. We must balance both in our lives to reach the goal of life. Hence, yog\u0101sans, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101m, and the science of proper diet are an essential part of Vedic knowledge. Each of the four Vedas has its associate Veda for material knowledge. The associate Veda of Atharva Veda is Ayurveda, which is the hoary science of medicine and good health. This demonstrates that the Vedas lay emphasis on the maintenance of physical health. Accordingly, Shree Krishna says that overeating or not eating at all, extreme activity or complete inactivity, etc. are all impediments to Yog.

By following this path, we can avoid the negative consequences of overindulgence while still enjoying life's pleasures in moderation.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, one of America's founding fathers, also recognized the importance of self-control and moderation in his personal development plan.

Being thus established, one is not shaken even in the midst of the greatest calamity.\n                        .\nIn the material realm, no extent of attainment satiates a person totally. A poor person strives hard to become rich, and feels satisfied if he or she is able to become a millionaire. But when that same millionaire looks at a billionaire, discontentment sets in again. The billionaire is also discontented by looking at an even richer person. No matter what happiness we get, when we perceive a higher state of happiness, the feeling of unfulfillment lingers. But happiness achieved from the state of Yog is the infinite bliss of God. Since there is nothing higher than that, on experiencing that infinite bliss, the soul naturally perceives that it has reached its goal..\nGod\u2019s divine bliss is also eternal, and it can never be snatched away from the yogi who has attained it once. Such a God-realized soul, though residing in the material body, remains in the state of divine consciousness. Sometimes, externally, it seems that the Saint is facing tribulations in the form of illness, antagonistic people, and oppressive environment, but internally the Saint retains divine consciousness and continues to relish the bliss of God. Thus, even the biggest difficulty cannot shake such a Saint. Established in union with God, the Saint rises above bodily consciousness and is thus not affected by bodily harm. Accordingly, we hear from the Puranas how Prahlad was put in a pit of snakes, tortured with weapons, placed in the fire, thrown off a cliff, etc. but none of these difficulties could break Prahlad\u2019s devotional union with God..\n\n", "interpretation": {"corporate": "In today's fast-paced and competitive corporate world, the concept of achieving infinite happiness and being unaffected by external circumstances is particularly relevant. Just as in the material realm, people strive for success and wealth, but once they reach a certain level, they still feel unfulfilled when they compare themselves to others who have more. However, true happiness comes from experiencing the divine bliss of God through the state of Yog. This infinite bliss is eternal and cannot be taken away, even in the face of adversity.\n\nIn the corporate world, this can translate into a sense of inner peace and contentment, which allows individuals to remain focused and productive despite external challenges or setbacks. They are not swayed by external circumstances because they have already achieved a state of union with God, which gives them a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment. This is not to say that they will never face difficulties, but rather that they can maintain their inner calm and perspective in the midst of them.\n\nIn fact, some spiritual leaders and successful businesspeople have attributed their success to this state of consciousness. They credit their ability to make wise decisions and remain focused on their goals to their connection with God. This is not to say that everyone needs to become a saint or renounce material life, but rather that finding inner peace and contentment can lead to greater success and fulfillment in all areas of life, including the corporate world.\n\nIn summary, the verse from Bhagvad Gita emphasizes the importance of achieving a state of union with God, which leads to infinite happiness and contentment, and allows individuals to remain unaffected by external circumstances.

However, as the verse from Bhagavad Gita highlights, this pursuit is never-ending and leaves us feeling unfulfilled in the long run. The concept of Yog, or divine consciousness, offers a different perspective on happiness and contentment.\n\nWhen we attain Yog, we realize that there is nothing greater than the infinite bliss of God. This realization brings about a shift in our perception, as we no longer see any material achievement as superior to this spiritual state. We become established in this divine consciousness, which cannot be shaken even in the midst of the greatest calamity.\n\nIn the modern world, this concept can be applied in various ways. For instance, entrepreneurs and businesspeople often strive for success and wealth, believing that these achievements will bring them true happiness. However, as the verse suggests, this pursuit is never-ending, and even the most successful person may still feel unfulfilled.\n\nIn contrast, a Saint who has attained Yog remains in divine consciousness, regardless of external circumstances. Though they may face difficulties and challenges, internally they remain unaffected by these events. This resilience and inner peace come from their union with God, which cannot be taken away by any material adversity.\n\nIn the startup world, this concept can help entrepreneurs to prioritize their goals and values. Rather than solely focusing on material success, they can strive for a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment through their work. This shift in perspective can lead to greater resilience, inner peace, and contentment, even in the face of challenges and setbacks.\n\nIn summary, the verse from Bhagavad Gita offers a powerful message about happiness and contentment that is relevant in today's world.

They view these obstacles as temporary and know that their connection with God will sustain them through any hardship.

Since there is nothing higher than this divine consciousness, we perceive that we have reached our ultimate goal. This realization brings about a sense of contentment and peace that is not affected by external circumstances or difficulties.\n\nIn other words, when we are established in the state of Yog, we remain in divine consciousness even while living in the material world. We may face challenges and hardships, but they do not shake our inner peace and happiness as we have already attained the highest state of being.

Here, Shree Krishna begins by describing the first part of the process\u2014taking the mind away from the world..\nThoughts of worldly things, people, events, etc. come to the mind when it is attached to the world. Initially, the thoughts are in the form of sphur\u1e47\u0101 (flashes of feelings and ideas). When we insist on the implementation of sphur\u1e47\u0101, it becomes sa\u1e45kalp. Thus, thoughts lead to sa\u1e45kalp (pursuit of these objects) and vikalp (revulsion from them), depending upon whether the attachment is positive or negative. The seed of pursuit and revulsion grows into the plant of desire, \u201cThis should happen. This should not happen.\u201d Both sa\u1e45kalp and vikalp immediately create impressions on the mind, like the film of a camera exposed to the light. Thus, they directly impede meditation upon God. They also have a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that is a seed today can become an inferno tomorrow. Thus, one who desires success in meditation should renounce the affinity for material objects..\nHaving described the first part of the process of meditation\u2014removing the mind from the world\u2014Shree Krishna then talks of the second part. The mind should be made to reside upon God. He says this will not happen automatically, but with determined effort, success will come slowly..\nDetermination of resolve that is in accordance with the scriptures is called dh\u1e5biti. This determination comes with conviction of the intellect. Many people acquire academic knowledge of the scriptures about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits. But their daily life is at variance with their knowledge, and they are seen to indulge in sin, sex, and intoxication. This happens because their intellect is not convinced about that knowledge. The power of discrimination comes with the conviction of the intellect about the impermanence of the world and the eternality of one\u2019s relationship with God. Thus utilizing the intellect, one must gradually cease sensual indulgence. This is called praty\u0101h\u0101r, or control of the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses. Success in praty\u0101h\u0101r will not come immediately. It will be achieved through gradual and repeated exercise.

These thoughts create impressions on the mind, which can hinder meditation.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, Shree Krishna advises us to renounce our affinity for material objects. This doesn't mean we should completely detach ourselves from the world, but rather that we should learn to observe it without attachment or craving. By doing so, we can prevent thoughts of the world from arising during meditation and instead focus on God.\n\nShree Krishna also emphasizes the importance of determination and conviction in our intellect. Many people have academic knowledge about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits, but they don't apply this knowledge to their daily lives.

Remove our minds from worldly thoughts by renouncing attachment to material objects.\n2. Develop determination and conviction in our intellect about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits.\n3.

This is the first step towards meditation, which requires removing the mind from worldly distractions and fixing it on God.\n\nIn modern times, this can be achieved by practicing mindfulness and detachment from material possessions. We must learn to distinguish between what we truly need and what we desire for superficial reasons. This will help us detach ourselves from the constant cravings that distract us from our spiritual pursuits.\n\nMoreover, we must learn to control our senses by practicing praty\u0101h\u0101r, which involves directing our mind away from external stimuli towards internal contemplation.

This principle of equality and empathy towards others is essential for building healthy relationships and creating a more just and compassionate society.", "student": "In today's world, this verse from the Bhagavad Gita encourages us to view all living beings as equal and to treat their joys and sorrows as our own. This means that we should be just as concerned about the well-being of others as we are about our own. It calls for a shift in perspective, where we see beyond the superficial differences that separate us and recognize the inherent worth and dignity of every human being.\n\nIn practical terms, this could mean volunteering at a homeless shelter, donating to charity, or simply showing kindness and compassion to those around us. It requires us to step outside our own narrow interests and consider the needs and feelings of others. By doing so, we can cultivate a sense of empathy and understanding that will help us to be more effective in our relationships with others and to contribute positively to society as a whole.\n\nIn short, this verse challenges us to see the world through a lens of equality and compassion, and to strive for the benefit of all rather than just ourselves.

Can you not defeat the mind?\u201d.\nShree Krishna does not deny the problem, by saying, \u201cArjun, what nonsense are you speaking? The mind can be controlled very easily.\u201d Rather, he agrees with Arjun\u2019s statement that the mind is indeed difficult to control. However, so many things are difficult to achieve in the world and yet we remain undaunted and move forward. For example, sailors know that the sea is dangerous and the possibility of terrible storms exists. Yet, they have never found those dangers as sufficient reasons for remaining ashore. Hence, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that the mind can be controlled by vair\u0101gya and abhy\u0101s..\nVair\u0101gya means detachment. We observe that the mind runs toward the objects of its attachment, toward the direction it has been habituated to running in the past. The elimination of attachment eradicates the unnecessary wanderings of the mind..\nAbhy\u0101s means practice, or a concerted and persistent effort to change an old habit or develop a new one. Practice is a very important word for s\u0101dhaks. In all fields of human endeavor, practice is the key that opens the door to mastery and excellence.

However, just as sailors face dangerous storms at sea but still persevere, we too can learn to master our minds through the practices of detachment and consistent effort.\n\nDetachment, or vair\u0101gya, involves letting go of attachments to external objects and focusing on the internal self. This means recognizing that true happiness and fulfillment come from within, rather than relying on external factors for satisfaction. By cultivating detachment, we can learn to let go of unnecessary thoughts and distractions, allowing our minds to rest in a state of calmness and clarity.\n\nConsistent effort, or abhy\u0101s, involves practicing a behavior or thought pattern repeatedly until it becomes second nature. This could be as simple as setting aside a few minutes each day for meditation, or making a conscious effort to focus on the present moment rather than dwelling on past regrets or future worries. By consistently practicing these habits, we can train our minds to stay focused and centered, even in the midst of distractions and chaos.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, these principles can be applied to various aspects of life, from work and relationships to personal growth and spirituality. For example, a startup founder might practice detachment by letting go of the need for external validation or approval, trusting in their own vision and inner strength instead. They might also practice consistent effort by setting aside time each day to reflect on their goals and priorities, making small but consistent steps towards achieving them over time.\n\nIn summary, just as Shree Krishna advised Arjun to control his mind through the practices of detachment and consistent effort, we too can learn to master our thoughts in today's world by cultivating these habits.

It reminds us that our efforts will not go in vain and that we have the support and protection of a higher power. This can provide us with the strength and courage to persevere through difficult times and continue on our paths towards self-realization.\n\nFurthermore, this verse encourages us to view spirituality as an ongoing process rather than a destination.

So, why should an unsuccessful yogi go to the celestial abodes? The reason is that the opposite of Yog (union with God) is bhog (material enjoyment). One falls from Yog because of the desire for bhog. So God, like an indulgent father, gives that fallen yogi a chance to engage in bhog in the next life and realize that it is an exercise in futility, which does not satiate the yearning of the soul for permanent bliss. So the fallen yogi is sometimes sent to the celestial abodes for a long time, and then again granted birth on Earth..\nSuch souls are then given birth in a family where they have the opportunity to continue their spiritual journey. \u015ahuch\u012b means those who are of pious and of good character; shree means those who are wealthy.

Such a family environment facilitates the opportunity to engage in spiritual pursuits for the souls who are so inclined..\nThe circumstances, situation, and family of our birth have an important bearing upon the course of our life. From our bodily parents we derive physical hereditary characteristics. This is the genetic process of heredity. However, there is also the process of social heredity. We blindly follow many customs because of the social environment of our upbringing. We do not choose to be Indians, Americans, British, etc. We identify ourselves with a nationality based upon our birth, and even go the extent of developing enmity with people of other nationalities. Invariably, we follow the religion of our parents, on the basis of social heredity..\nThus, the place and family of our birth has a great impact upon our direction and attainment in life. If the place and family of birth were arbitrarily decided in every life, there would be no justice in the world. However, God has an account of all our thoughts and actions of endless lifetimes. In accordance with the law of karma, the spiritual assets earned by the unsuccessful yogi in the previous life bear fruit. Accordingly, those yogis who had traversed quite a distance and developed dispassion are not sent to the celestial abodes.

Eventually, they are born again on Earth, either into a family with pious values or into a wealthy one that provides them with the resources to focus on spiritual growth. This concept highlights how our circumstances and environment at birth can greatly impact the course of our lives, as we inherit both physical and social heredity from our parents. However, this is not arbitrary; it is based on the law of karma, where our past actions determine our future experiences.

The circumstances and environment of our birth have a significant impact on our direction and attainment in life. We inherit physical characteristics from our biological parents through genetic heredity, but we also inherit social heredity through the customs and traditions of our upbringing.

Just as sailors use favorable winds to help them reach their destination, those who have practiced spiritual principles in previous lifetimes can harness this momentum to further their progress in the present. Shree Krishna emphasizes that true success in spirituality comes not from a single burst of effort but from sustained and deepened practice over many lives. In other words, our past experiences should inform and guide our actions in the present, allowing us to make more meaningful and impactful contributions to society and ourselves. By recognizing the continuity of our efforts across lifetimes, we can approach our work with a greater sense of purpose, focus, and resilience. This perspective can also help us navigate challenges and setbacks with greater equanimity, knowing that our long-term goals are still within reach. Ultimately, the Bhagavad Gita encourages us to view success as a journey, not a destination, and to cultivate the patience, persistence, and self-reflection necessary to make steady progress over time.", "startup": "In today's fast-paced and competitive world, success often requires more than just hard work and dedication in a single lifetime. The Bhagavad Gita teaches us that the progress we make towards our goals is not limited to this life alone but accumulates over multiple lifetimes. This concept is particularly relevant for entrepreneurs and startups who are constantly striving for innovation, growth, and success.\n\nThe verse 6.45 from the Bhagavad Gita encourages us to view our current endeavors as a continuation of our past efforts. It highlights that the knowledge, skills, and experiences gained in previous lifetimes can serve as a helpful breeze for spiritual progress, which in this context could be interpreted as professional or personal growth.\n\nIn the modern world, this verse can be applied to startups by emphasizing the importance of building on past successes rather than starting from scratch every time. Entrepreneurs who have previously founded successful companies or worked in similar industries can leverage their accumulated knowledge and networks to gain a competitive edge. This approach not only saves time but also ensures that mistakes made in previous ventures are avoided.\n\nMoreover, the verse encourages us to continue striving harder than before, even if we have not achieved our goals in past lifetimes or ventures. The word tu in this context implies that our current endeavors should be deeper and more focused than those of our past lives. This approach helps us to take advantage of the momentum carried forward from our past experiences and allows us to make faster progress towards our goals.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bhagavad Gita's teachings on accumulated practice and spiritual progress can provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs and startups in the modern world.

This requires continuous effort and dedication, as Shree Krishna emphasizes the importance of deeper endeavor than before. While it may seem that some people achieve spiritual perfection quickly in this life, it is actually a result of the accumulated practice from many lifetimes. Therefore, we should not underestimate the significance of our past experiences and strive to build upon them in our present journey towards self-realization.", "student": "In today's world, this verse can be interpreted as follows: Our past actions and experiences, whether good or bad, have an impact on our present and future endeavors.

This means that we should not underestimate the power of past experiences, but rather use them as a foundation for further growth and development.

However, Shree Krishna's teachings in Bhagvad Gita remind us that true success lies in striving for something greater than ourselves - God.\n\nThe verse 6.46 highlights this by comparing the yogi to other spiritual seekers like ascetics, scholars, and ritualistic performers. While these individuals are admirable in their own right, they are still focused on attaining worldly gains through mortification, learning, or rituals. The yogi, on the other hand, goes beyond these pursuits and aims for a spiritual connection with God.\n\nIn the context of the modern world, this means that true success is not just about achieving professional milestones or financial goals but also about cultivating a deeper sense of purpose and meaning in life. It's about recognizing that our work and achievements are not an end in themselves but rather a means to serve others and contribute to society.\n\nAs we strive for excellence in our careers, let us also remember the importance of spiritual growth and self-reflection. By following the path of yoga, we can develop qualities like selflessness, discipline, and inner peace that will help us navigate the challenges of corporate life with grace and wisdom.

However, as Shree Krishna explains in Bhagvad Gita verse 6.46, there are different paths people take to achieve these ends - tapasvi (ascetic), jnani (person of learning) and karmi (ritualistic performer). While all these paths have their own merits, Shree Krishna declares that the yogi is superior to them all.\n\nThe reason for this is simple - while the tapasvi, jnani, and karmi are all striving for worldly attainment, the yogi's goal is spiritual. The yogi's accomplishment is at a higher level of existence, as they are not just focused on material gains but also on achieving a deeper connection with God.\n\nIn today's startup world, where success often means financial gain and societal recognition, it can be easy to forget this lesson.

Therefore, Arjuna, strive to become a yogi.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"yoga\" is often associated with physical exercises and meditation techniques that promote health and well-being. However, in this context, yoga refers to a spiritual practice that aims to connect the individual soul (jiva) with the supreme soul (Paramatma). The yogi seeks to transcend material desires and attain a state of pure consciousness, whereas the tapasvi, jnani, and karmi are still focused on achieving worldly goals. Therefore, Shree Krishna declares that the yogi's spiritual accomplishment is superior to theirs.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that someone who practices yoga regularly may have a more balanced and peaceful mindset, which can lead to better decision-making abilities and relationships with others. They may also be less affected by material desires and more focused on serving others and contributing to society. Overall, the yogi's spiritual growth can have positive impacts on their personal relations in the modern world.", "student": "In today's world, we can interpret this verse in several ways. Firstly, let's understand what each of these terms means in a modern context:\n\n1. Yogi: A person who practices yoga, not just as a physical exercise but also as a spiritual discipline that helps them connect with their inner self and ultimately achieve a state of peace and enlightenment.\n\n2. Ascetic: Someone who chooses to live a simple, disciplined life, often renouncing material possessions and pleasures in pursuit of spiritual growth.\n\n3. Person of learning: An individual who is well-educated and knowledgeable about various subjects, including philosophy, science, and religion.\n\n4. Ritualistic performer: Someone who follows religious rituals and ceremonies as a means of attaining material benefits or spiritual merit.\n\nShree Krishna's statement in the Bhagavad Gita that a yogi is superior to all these other categories holds true even today. Here's why:\n\n1. A yogi's ultimate goal is not worldly attainment but spiritual growth, which is at a higher level than material or intellectual achievements.\n\n2. While ascetics may renounce material possessions and pleasures, their focus is still on the body and its limitations. Yoga helps us transcend these limitations and connect with our true selves, which is beyond the physical body.\n\n3. Knowledge is important, but it's not enough to achieve spiritual growth. A yogi combines knowledge with practical experience and self-realization.\n\n4. Rituals can be a means of attaining material benefits or spiritual merit, but they are not the end goal. Yoga helps us go beyond rituals and ceremonies and connect directly with the divine.\n\nIn short, a yogi's focus on spiritual growth and self-realization makes them superior to those who are focused solely on worldly attainment or intellectual pursuits."}}, "6.47": {"sanskrit": " \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u093e\u092e\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0926\u094d\u0917\u0924\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e |\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092d\u091c\u0924\u0947 \u092f\u094b \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0938 \u092e\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0924\u092e\u094b \u092e\u0924: || 47||.\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63h\u0101\u1e41 mad-gaten\u0101ntar-\u0101tman\u0101\u015bhraddh\u0101v\u0101n bhajate yo m\u0101\u1e41 sa me yuktatamo mata\u1e25.\nyoginam api sarvesham mad-gatenantar-atmanashraddhavan bhajate yo mam sa me yuktatamo matah.", "english": " Of all yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in Me, and who engage in devotion to Me with great faith, them I consider to be the highest of all.\n                        .\nEven amongst yogis, there are karm yogis, bhakti yogis, j\u00f1\u0101na yogis, a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yogis, etc. This verse puts to rest the debate about which form of Yog is the highest.
